Hi.,Ann Perkins
"Hi, hi.",Ann Perkins
Hi.,Ann Perkins
I'm Ann Perkins.,Ann Perkins
"I'm a nurse, and frankly, I don't really care for politics, but I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street.",Ann Perkins
Excellent.,Leslie Knope
That sounds like a good idea.,Leslie Knope
Tell us about that.,Leslie Knope
"No, it's a problem.",Ann Perkins
It almost killed my boyfriend.,Ann Perkins
Oh.,Leslie Knope
Yeah.,Ann Perkins
"There's a lot nearby my house, and a developer dug out a basement for some condos, and then they went bankrupt, so there's just this giant pit, and it's been there for almost a year.",Ann Perkins
"Twelve months, yes.",Leslie Knope
Go on.,Leslie Knope
"Yeah, and my boyfriend, who is a musician, actually, I support him, but anyway, he fell in and broke both his legs.",Ann Perkins
"Ann, let me speak with you for a minute.",Tom Haverford
"So, your boyfriend fell down into this pit, right?",Tom Haverford
Yes.,Ann Perkins
"And, this guy, is it pretty serious?",Tom Haverford
Are you guys living together?,Tom Haverford
Yes.,Ann Perkins
"Wow, I'm sure this must be really tough for you.",Tom Haverford
"You know, just, this guy, sounds like he didn't have a lot going on for him to start with, and now both legs broken.",Tom Haverford
He's just weak.,Tom Haverford
You have to take care of him.,Tom Haverford
You probably feel like you need to move on.,Tom Haverford
What does this--,Ann Perkins
"Just become more adventurous in relationships with your body, just in",Tom Haverford
Are you actually hitting on me right now?,Ann Perkins
Oh.,Tom Haverford
Oh.,Tom Haverford
"God, no.",Tom Haverford
I'm not hitting on you.,Tom Haverford
I'm actually married.,Tom Haverford
"I'm just an open person, and I like connecting with people.",Tom Haverford
"I'm, you know, very comfortable around women, attractive women.",Tom Haverford
I've spent a lot of time with them.,Tom Haverford
And I just-- I don't know.,Tom Haverford
I feel like we might be taking up too much of the forum's time.,Tom Haverford
Maybe we can just exchange numbers.,Tom Haverford
"You know, maybe go away one weekend and just kind of talk about this.",Tom Haverford
Look --,Ann Perkins
I'd love to do it.,Tom Haverford
"The bottom line is I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and nobody's done anything, and it's ugly, and it's dangerous, and it's government owned, and you need to do something about it.",Ann Perkins
Okay.,Leslie Knope
I'll do something about it.,Leslie Knope
Really?,Ann Perkins
"Yes, we-- I will help you.",Leslie Knope
Is that a promise?,Ann Perkins
It's more than a promise.,Leslie Knope
It's a pinky promise.,Leslie Knope
"I pinky promise all of you that I will help, and I will go to that location tomorrow, and we will fill in that pit, and then when that's done, we're gonna put a park on the land.",Leslie Knope
Okay.,Ann Perkins
"Well, I've worked at the Parks Department for six years, and I've handled a lot of things that I'm proud of.",Leslie Knope
"Recently, I led a city-wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats.",Leslie Knope
"But this pit, the chance to build a whole new park from scratch, this could be my Hoover Dam.",Leslie Knope
"No, that sounds great.",Tom Haverford
"Problem is, anything over 25 dollars I have to report, so maybe give my wife a call and give her the suits, and then if they don't fit her, maybe she'll give them to me.",Tom Haverford
Morning.,Leslie Knope
"All right, Mr. Mayor.",Tom Haverford
That sounds good.,Tom Haverford
I'll see you on Saturday for the Ultimate Frisbee game.,Tom Haverford
Bye.,Tom Haverford
"Leslie, hello.",Tom Haverford
You were talking to the mayor?,Leslie Knope
"Yep, we were just rapping about some things.",Tom Haverford
Tom and I work really well together.,Leslie Knope
We're both outsiders.,Leslie Knope
"I'm a woman, he's a... I think he's a Libyan.",Leslie Knope
"I am from Bennettsville, South Carolina.",Tom Haverford
I am what you might call a redneck.,Tom Haverford
"Okay, brainstorm.",Leslie Knope
How do we make this park happen?,Leslie Knope
Let's go to the city council directly and ask them to put up the money.,Tom Haverford
"No, parks are not a priority.",Leslie Knope
I need more firepower.,Leslie Knope
I need bigger guns.,Leslie Knope
You know what I need to do?,Leslie Knope
Form a committee.,Leslie Knope
Right?,Leslie Knope
"Yeah, that could work.",Tom Haverford
"Yeah, 'cause committees are power, and committees make things happen.",Leslie Knope
Committees are the lifeblood of our democratic system.,Leslie Knope
That's really good.,Leslie Knope
Write that down.,Leslie Knope
Yep.,Tom Haverford
"From time to time, when I think of an eloquent saying or a phrase, I have Tom write it down.",Leslie Knope
He's collecting them for my memoirs.,Leslie Knope
Here's Leslie's quote from Wednesday.,Tom Haverford
"Okay, read it back to me.",Leslie Knope
"Um ""Committees cover our democracy with blood.""",Tom Haverford
Hmm.,Leslie Knope
Sounded better when I said it.,Leslie Knope
"It's still good, though.",Leslie Knope
"Okay, I have an idea.",Leslie Knope
What about bringing Mark on board?,Leslie Knope
Which Mark?,Tom Haverford
Which Mark?,Leslie Knope
Mark Brendanawicz.,Leslie Knope
Which Mark?,Leslie Knope
"Well, if you want something done in this town, you call Mark Brendanawicz because, you know, he's a city planner, but he's more than that.",Leslie Knope
He's kind of like a fixer.,Leslie Knope
He fixes things.,Leslie Knope
"He's a smart, capable guy.",Leslie Knope
He just-- He knows where the bodies are buried.,Leslie Knope
"What's up, Brendanawicz?",Leslie Knope
You crazy old Polish person.,Leslie Knope
"City Hall is like a locker room, and you gotta get in there, and you gotta snap towels at people, and you gotta give them the business, and if you can't take it, you know, you... Then you can't take it.",Leslie Knope
You gotta leave the locker room.,Leslie Knope
Let's get down to brass tacks.,Leslie Knope
I know you don't have a lot of time and I want to thank you for meeting me today.,Leslie Knope
I just work right there.,Mark Brendanawicz
"Well, thank you for clearing your schedule.",Leslie Knope
I didn't clear anything.,Mark Brendanawicz
"You know this lot that I'm talking about, right?",Leslie Knope
"Yeah, Lot 48.",Mark Brendanawicz
Condo developer.,Mark Brendanawicz
"He dug a basement, and then he went bankrupt.",Mark Brendanawicz
I checked it out like a month ago.,Mark Brendanawicz
It's pretty gross.,Mark Brendanawicz
What would you say if I told you that I was thinking about turning it into a park?,Leslie Knope
"A park, huh?",Mark Brendanawicz
Okay.,Mark Brendanawicz
"Well, when I think about the logistics, the various hoops that you're gonna have to jump through, I would say, is it likely?",Mark Brendanawicz
"No, it's not likely, you know.",Mark Brendanawicz
"But, is it possible?",Mark Brendanawicz
No.,Mark Brendanawicz
It's not possible.,Mark Brendanawicz
I would give up on that one.,Mark Brendanawicz
What?,Leslie Knope
Why?,Leslie Knope
Why?,Mark Brendanawicz
I don't know.,Mark Brendanawicz
There's like a million reasons why.,Mark Brendanawicz
"Homeowners' associations, anti-government nuts, bureaucrats, miles of red tape--",Mark Brendanawicz
Really?,Leslie Knope
It sounds like you're telling me to go for it.,Leslie Knope
There's no way it can happen.,Mark Brendanawicz
I can do this.,Leslie Knope
I just need a little help.,Leslie Knope
"Could you do me a favor, for old times' sake?",Leslie Knope
Mark and I-- It's complicated.,Leslie Knope
"When you work closely with someone and you share similar interests and you have a similar world view and you're passionate about the same things, things can happen.",Leslie Knope
We slept together.,Leslie Knope
Leslie?,Mark Brendanawicz
No.,Mark Brendanawicz
"Oh, my God.",Mark Brendanawicz
You know what?,Mark Brendanawicz
"Yeah, we did, like, five years ago.",Mark Brendanawicz
"I sort of-- No, but yeah.",Mark Brendanawicz
"Yeah, we did.",Mark Brendanawicz
"Honey, can you straighten up your area a little bit?",Ann Perkins
'Cause they're gonna be here soon.,Ann Perkins
Can-- Thanks.,Ann Perkins
"That parks lady is coming over, and we're gonna go take a look at the pit.",Ann Perkins
I think it's probably just a photo op for her.,Ann Perkins
"I mean, I don't think anybody in government actually cares about--",Ann Perkins
"Honey, do you mind doing that somewhere else?",Andy Dwyer
I'm trying to watch TV.,Andy Dwyer
I'm talking about the pit you fell in.,Ann Perkins
It's Ms. Perkins' house.,Leslie Knope
Doorbell!,Andy Dwyer
"Yeah, I heard it.",Ann Perkins
Doorbell!,Andy Dwyer
I heard it.,Ann Perkins
I'm getting it.,Ann Perkins
I'm here.,Leslie Knope
Hey!,Ann Perkins
Wow!,Ann Perkins
Look at that.,Ann Perkins
Safety.,Leslie Knope
You remember Tom from last night.,Leslie Knope
"Hey, Ann, how are you?",Tom Haverford
"Yeah, hey.",Ann Perkins
Of course I do.,Ann Perkins
"And this is our college intern, April.",Leslie Knope
She's going to be documenting our fact finding mission.,Leslie Knope
"Hey, April.",Ann Perkins
Hey.,April Ludgate
Is this fun for you?,Ann Perkins
"Yeah, it's so much fun.",April Ludgate
I'm just gonna grab my phone quickly.,Ann Perkins
Sorry.,Ann Perkins
This must be our hero.,Leslie Knope
The man heard 'round the world.,Leslie Knope
Uh-huh.,Andy Dwyer
"How you doing, son?",Leslie Knope
Pretty good.,Andy Dwyer
I'm Leslie Knope.,Leslie Knope
And the entire government of Pawnee would like to let you know that we will do everything we can to help you.,Leslie Knope
Could you pass me my itch stick?,Andy Dwyer
Of course.,Leslie Knope
"So, Andy jumped over this fence.",Ann Perkins
"He was crossing through to get home, and then he fell right there.",Ann Perkins
"Oh, my God.",Leslie Knope
How did we let this happen?,Leslie Knope
"Dream with me for a second, Ann.",Leslie Knope
Doesn't this neighborhood deserve a first-class park?,Leslie Knope
"Imagine a shiny new playground with a jungle gym and swings, pool, tennis courts, volleyball courts, racquetball courts, basketball court, regulation football field.",Leslie Knope
We could put an amphitheatre over there with Shakespeare in the Park.,Leslie Knope
It's really not that big of a pit.,Ann Perkins
We could do some of those things.,Leslie Knope
It's gonna take a little extra work.,Leslie Knope
But why not try?,Leslie Knope
I think that would be great.,Ann Perkins
"Me, too.",Leslie Knope
I'm going in.,Leslie Knope
Why?,Ann Perkins
Don't worry.,Leslie Knope
I have a hard hat on.,Leslie Knope
"I can see that, but--",Ann Perkins
Yeah.,Leslie Knope
"April, document this.",Leslie Knope
Document what?,April Ludgate
"The key to any factfinding mission is to get right into the battle zone, you know?",Leslie Knope
It's like George Bush when he flew over New Orleans or Richard Nixon when he went to China to see what the Chinese were up to.,Leslie Knope
No!,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, are you okay?",Ann Perkins
Leslie!,Tom Haverford
"Hold on, April's gonna get some photos for the website.",Tom Haverford
Could you just be still?,April Ludgate
Don't move around as much.,Tom Haverford
"Okay, squeeze my fingers.",Ann Perkins
Good.,Ann Perkins
Does it hurt a lot?,Ann Perkins
No.,Leslie Knope
Mmmmmm.,Leslie Knope
I'm fine.,Leslie Knope
"No, you're not.",Ann Perkins
Good thing I was wearing that hard hat.,Leslie Knope
But it-- It fell off.,Ann Perkins
After my head hit that rod.,Leslie Knope
Wow.,Ann Perkins
"I can't believe you fell in, too.",Andy Dwyer
That's awesome.,Andy Dwyer
"It's not awesome, Andy.",Ann Perkins
"Well, at least my boss will listen to me now that I broke my clavicle.",Leslie Knope
It's not broken.,Ann Perkins
It is.,Leslie Knope
Do you have one of those neck foam collar brace things?,Leslie Knope
"Honestly, you're fine.",Ann Perkins
"Honestly, my clavicle's broken.",Leslie Knope
"Oh, hey, baby, if you're going to the kitchen, could you make me pancakes real quick?",Andy Dwyer
Sure.,Ann Perkins
Ooh!,Leslie Knope
Are pancakes being made?,Leslie Knope
Thank you.,Leslie Knope
Sure.,Ann Perkins
"I don't know, she's a little doofy, but she's sweet.",Ann Perkins
"Ron, please.",Leslie Knope
No.,Ron Swanson
No way.,Ron Swanson
"Come on, Ron.",Leslie Knope
I've been a loyal foot soldier.,Leslie Knope
Give me my shot.,Leslie Knope
Let me have Lot 48.,Leslie Knope
Is that a travel pillow around your neck?,Ron Swanson
"Ron, I don't know how to explain this to you.",Leslie Knope
When you've been down in the pit-- Have you been in the pit?,Leslie Knope
"No, I haven't gotten down there yet.",Ron Swanson
"Well, I have.",Leslie Knope
When you fell in.,Ron Swanson
When I visited the bottom of the pit on a fact finding mission.,Leslie Knope
"And when you're down there, you get some perspective about what it all means.",Leslie Knope
"And let me tell you something, Ron.",Leslie Knope
What it means is I want this subcommittee.,Leslie Knope
I've been quite open about this around the office.,Ron Swanson
I don't want this Parks Department to build any parks because I don't believe in government.,Ron Swanson
I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money.,Ron Swanson
My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations.,Ron Swanson
Like Chuck E. Cheese.,Ron Swanson
They have an impeccable business model.,Ron Swanson
I would rather work for Chuck E. Cheese.,Ron Swanson
"Well, I will definitely think about it.",Ron Swanson
I like the sound of that definitely.,Leslie Knope
I'm gonna leave before you change your mind.,Leslie Knope
"Mr. Swanson, I presume.",Leslie Knope
Lot 46 thoughts? Yes? No? Me? Park?,Leslie Knope
Giving the park to me?,Leslie Knope
Still mulling.,Ron Swanson
She's insatiable.,Ron Swanson
She's like a little dog with a chew toy.,Ron Swanson
"All right, you guys.",Leslie Knope
"All right, all right.",Leslie Knope
I'll ask him.,Leslie Knope
Everybody wants to know what your decision is.,Leslie Knope
Someone on the phone about the park.,Leslie Knope
"You know, I don't think I even want it.",Leslie Knope
Oh man.,Leslie Knope
My clavicle's still really hurting me.,Leslie Knope
Oh!,Tom Haverford
This is a great shot.,Tom Haverford
I know.,April Ludgate
That's awesome.,Tom Haverford
I think she's crying in that one.,April Ludgate
Look at this one.,April Ludgate
"Hey, kids.",Mark Brendanawicz
That's another good one.,Tom Haverford
Hey.,April Ludgate
"Hey, Brendanawicz.",Tom Haverford
You gotta come check this out.,Tom Haverford
"Leslie took us out to that pit in Lot 48, and she fell inside.",Tom Haverford
And we have some awesome photos.,Tom Haverford
One.,April Ludgate
Is she okay?,Mark Brendanawicz
"Yeah, she's fine.",Tom Haverford
Oh! This is a classic.,Tom Haverford
That's the best one.,April Ludgate
The up-skirt photo.,Tom Haverford
Awesome.,Tom Haverford
"Hey, man.",Tom Haverford
Give me the photo back.,Tom Haverford
What's going on?,Tom Haverford
Don't worry.,April Ludgate
I can print more.,April Ludgate
Leslie is unique.,Mark Brendanawicz
Government work can beat you down.,Mark Brendanawicz
I would say that I lost my optimism about government in about two months.,Mark Brendanawicz
Leslie's kept hers for six years.,Mark Brendanawicz
"I've got a few rules about how to survive and prosper in a government job, and I think I'm about to break one of those rules.",Mark Brendanawicz
I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie so she can try to build a park.,Mark Brendanawicz
Why should I?,Ron Swanson
"You owe me one, remember?",Mark Brendanawicz
Do you want to cash in for this?,Ron Swanson
"Yeah, I do.",Mark Brendanawicz
"So this was built in 1935, it's called Pioneer Hall. And a little trivia, it is one of the first structures in America to ever have locks.",Leslie Knope
Wow!,Ann Perkins
"Oh, yeah.",Leslie Knope
This is our crown jewel.,Leslie Knope
It's one of our best murals.,Leslie Knope
It depicts the very famous battle at Conega Creek.,Leslie Knope
"We have a lot of children visit, so often we have to cover up the more gruesome parts with a poster.",Leslie Knope
That is horrifying.,Ann Perkins
"Yes, it is.",Leslie Knope
"So, what do you want to see? The DMV? Animal control? Or we could--",Leslie Knope
Leslie! We did it.,Tom Haverford
Ron's approved our committee.,Tom Haverford
"Oh, my God.",Ann Perkins
That's great!,Leslie Knope
That's so great.,Ann Perkins
That's so exciting! This is huge.,Leslie Knope
"I'm barely 34, and I've already landed a Parks Department exploratory subcommittee.",Leslie Knope
I'm a rocket ship.,Leslie Knope

"Yeah, call one.",Tom Haverford
Definitely.,Tom Haverford
I would.,Mark Brendanawicz
"Every now and then we have these little gatherings, and Leslie gets plastered.",Tom Haverford
One time I convinced her to try to fax someone a Fruit Roll-Up.,Tom Haverford
She one time made out with the water delivery guy in her office.,Tom Haverford
"On Halloween, she was dressed up as Batman.",Tom Haverford
Not Batgirl.,Tom Haverford
Batman.,Tom Haverford
And I convinced her to go stop a crime that was going on outside.,Tom Haverford
And it is my favorite thing in the world.,Tom Haverford
You know what?,Leslie Knope
America is awesome.,Leslie Knope
It's so full of hope and small towns and big cities and real people and delicious beverages and hot guys.,Leslie Knope
You just never know when opportunity is gonna strike.,Leslie Knope
Yeah.,Ann Perkins
You gotta be ready for it.,Leslie Knope
Yeah.,Ann Perkins
Are you excited?,Leslie Knope
Definitely am.,Ann Perkins
Fired up.,Ann Perkins
Yeah!,Leslie Knope
I'm really fired up.,Ann Perkins
"You know they say that democracy or whatever only works when people get involved? Well, I'm getting involved.",Ann Perkins
So I am gonna make a vow now that I will do whatever it takes to get this pit filled in.,Ann Perkins
Even if it takes two months.,Ann Perkins
"Soul sista, soul sista Gonna get your phone, sista",Leslie Knope
Yeah.,Ann Perkins
Sweet Lady Marmalard,Leslie Knope
I've created this office as a symbol of how I feel about government.,Ron Swanson
This sawed-off shotgun belonged to a local bootlegger.,Ron Swanson
People who come in here to ask me for things have to stare right down the barrel.,Ron Swanson
Did you guys get a grant to do this? This is my basketball court.,Ron Swanson
I don't want to see any double dribble.,Ron Swanson
I don't want to see any three second violations.,Ron Swanson
Bobby Knight!,Ron Swanson
"Well, one of the funner things that we do here in Pawnee is the annual Easter egg hunt.",Leslie Knope
"Tom hides the eggs, and I have to say he did an exceptional job this year.",Leslie Knope
I've been searching for 25 minutes and I haven't found a single egg.,Leslie Knope
And I'm an adult.,Leslie Knope
Oh.,Tom Haverford
"Yeah, I forgot to do that.",Tom Haverford
Maybe Tom's trying to make this year a challenge.,Leslie Knope
"And if so, he's succeeding.",Leslie Knope
I don't think a single egg has been found yet.,Leslie Knope
Let's keep looking.,Leslie Knope
We're gonna find one.,Leslie Knope
I'm going to see my mom.,Leslie Knope
She's a big mucky-muck in the county school system.,Leslie Knope
She's my hero.,Leslie Knope
How do I explain her?,Leslie Knope
She's as respected as Mother Teresa.,Leslie Knope

Okay.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, I just have to say, I think you might be taking this to the public a little bit too soon.",Mark Brendanawicz
It literally doesn't matter what you propose to the public.,Mark Brendanawicz
"They might call for a vote, and if they vote you down, then you're done.",Mark Brendanawicz
I don't care if there's gonna be a vote.,Leslie Knope
"I have a secret weapon, canvassing.",Leslie Knope
Nothing better than good old-fashioned door-to-door campaigning.,Leslie Knope
I'm not above using my expertise to change hearts and minds if the cause is just.,Leslie Knope
"When I was in sixth grade, I was voted Best Dressed by 87 votes.",Leslie Knope
And there were only 63 people in my class. Andy fell into that pit.,Leslie Knope

"Because, you know, I really can't move again.",Extra
"April, please stand behind me.",Mark Brendanawicz
That's it.,Mark Brendanawicz
That's all.,Mark Brendanawicz

Peace.,Tom Haverford
He runs weird.,April Ludgate
He really does.,Mark Brendanawicz
It's a good idea.,Extra

"If you want to guarantee the results of a survey, you design the question to give you the answer that you want.",Leslie Knope
"""Wouldn't you rather have a park than a storage facility for nuclear waste?""",Ann Perkins

"Yeah, don't worry about it, I made it all up.",Leslie Knope
"Yeah, that's what I mean.",Ann Perkins
"Wouldn't you agree, like most decent Americans, that it would be a good idea to turn the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street into a beautiful community park?",Leslie Knope

You don't care about your kids if you don't support this park!,Leslie Knope

Andy.,Leslie Knope

Did you say something?,Paul

It's horrifying.,Ron Swanson

Come on.,Andy Dwyer
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on I came in through the window last night,Andy Dwyer
It can be tricky dealing,Mark Brendanawicz
Don't-- Why do I want to build this park so bad?,Leslie Knope
Maybe because a pit filled with garbage isn't the best that we can do in America.,Leslie Knope
"You know, in Russia, they could pretend that pit was a park, bring their kids down there.",Leslie Knope
"""Hey, Vlad! Look at these rocks! Let's pretend they're potatoes!""",Leslie Knope
"""Nikolai! Do you want to swim in the dirt?""",Leslie Knope
But not here.,Leslie Knope
Okay?,Leslie Knope
'Cause we're a nation of dreamers.,Leslie Knope
And it is my dream to build a park.,Leslie Knope
That I one day visit with my White House staff on my birthday.,Leslie Knope
"And they say, ""President Knope, this park is awesome.""",Leslie Knope

"Leslie Knope, builder of parks.",Ron Swanson

Postpone?,Ron Swanson
Only for 1 to 90 days.,Leslie Knope
No.,Ron Swanson
You're doing this meeting.,Ron Swanson
You have my full support.,Ron Swanson

"Um, there's a mutual respect there.",Ron Swanson
"And together, we have decided to fast-track your project.",Ron Swanson
City manager?,Leslie Knope
Wow.,Leslie Knope
Really?,Leslie Knope
I have to cancel this meeting.,Leslie Knope
Fast-track?,Leslie Knope

Okay?,Ron Swanson
We have to push this thing through.,Ron Swanson
Of course.,Leslie Knope
Of course.,Leslie Knope
I'll push anything through anything.,Leslie Knope
You know me.,Leslie Knope
Are you sweating through your suit?,Ron Swanson
I doubt it.,Leslie Knope
It's a very breathable fabric--,Leslie Knope
"Oh, yeah.",Leslie Knope
I am.,Leslie Knope
"Jerry, what's up, man?",Tom Haverford
"Hey, you're into pretzels, right?",Tom Haverford
Bam!,Tom Haverford
"Hit them up, man.",Tom Haverford
Thanks for coming down.,Tom Haverford
I got a seat taped off for you over there.,Tom Haverford
"My top priority with this park, getting your fences in there.",Tom Haverford
I drove by one of your fences the other day.,Tom Haverford
"I was like, ""Man, that fence looks awesome.""",Tom Haverford
"I was like, of course, Roy's.",Tom Haverford
"If you're into chocolate muffins, grab as many you want.",Tom Haverford
Some people may say that bringing in these contractors this early is jumping the gun a little bit.,Tom Haverford
"Well, guess what?",Tom Haverford
"Here's the gun, here's me.",Tom Haverford
Boom!,Tom Haverford
Victor Miles.,Tom Haverford
Tom Haverford.,Tom Haverford

Thank you so much for coming down.,Tom Haverford
I want to introduce you to Leslie.,Tom Haverford
Victor Miles.,Tom Haverford
Hi.,Leslie Knope
He's a gentleman I met canvassing.,Tom Haverford

"This will be fine, right?",Ann Perkins
It's a park for God's sakes.,Andy Dwyer
How much can they hate a park?,Andy Dwyer
A lot of them seemed to hate a park yesterday.,Ann Perkins
April.,Leslie Knope
"April, I need you in the audience.",Leslie Knope
Okay.,April Ludgate
"Wait, and if the questions start getting negative, I'm gonna call on you.",Leslie Knope
And I need you to sell the crap out of the park.,Leslie Knope
Can you do that?,Leslie Knope
Why?,April Ludgate
"Please, April!",Leslie Knope
This is serious!,Leslie Knope
Can you do that?,Leslie Knope
Probably.,April Ludgate
"Good girl, good girl, good ""probably.""",Leslie Knope
Good girl.,Leslie Knope
"Okay, here we go.",Leslie Knope
"Line up, everybody.",Leslie Knope
My mom's here.,Leslie Knope
My mom's here.,Leslie Knope
My mom's here.,Leslie Knope
No.,Leslie Knope
I can't do that.,Leslie Knope
That's illegal.,Leslie Knope
Thank you so much for coming out tonight.,Leslie Knope
This is our first town meeting about the proposal to turn Lot 48 on Sullivan Street into a community park.,Leslie Knope
Yeah!,Leslie Knope
This is gonna be a train wreck.,Marlene Griggs-Knope
"I want my daughter to be successful, which is why I always tell her, ""There's nothing wrong with being a wife and mother.""",Marlene Griggs-Knope
"Now, there are many people that I spoke to who are passionately in support of this idea.",Leslie Knope
"None of them were able to make it tonight, unfortunately.",Leslie Knope
But they totally exist.,Leslie Knope
I did not make them up.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, I see a question.",Leslie Knope
Okay.,Leslie Knope
"No, no.",Leslie Knope
No.,Leslie Knope
No questions right now.,Leslie Knope
My name is Kate Spivack.,Kate Spivack
Mmmhmm.,Leslie Knope
I remember you.,Leslie Knope
And I live in the neighborhood.,Kate Spivack
And I am 100% against this park.,Kate Spivack
"I cannot believe the department is moving forward with a project without a single environmental impact study, and if you guys agree with me, let's take a stand.",Kate Spivack
Okay.,Leslie Knope
"We are a little ahead of schedule, because we're holding this town hall meeting so soon, which I was warned about by Mark Brendanawicz, our city planner assigned to this project.",Leslie Knope
"Uh... So, what would he say?",Leslie Knope
Here we are.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, should I give them some background info on the site?",Mark Brendanawicz
Absolutely.,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Leslie Knope
Mark Brendanawicz knows the answer to every question.,Leslie Knope
He's amazing and congratulations for hearing him speak.,Leslie Knope
Hi there.,Mark Brendanawicz
Leslie might have oversold me a little bit.,Mark Brendanawicz
Certainly did not.,Leslie Knope
He's the man.,Leslie Knope
He's capable of anything.,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Leslie Knope
Lot 48 is It's a rectangular lot.,Mark Brendanawicz
It's got excellent drainage.,Mark Brendanawicz
And it's on the corner of Sullivan and Collins.,Mark Brendanawicz
Any questions?,Mark Brendanawicz
I have more of a comment than a question.,Lawrence
Go for it.,Mark Brendanawicz
It's for the guy in the casts.,Lawrence
"Here we go, Lawrence.",Andy Dwyer
Yes.,Leslie Knope
Yes.,Leslie Knope
Yes.,Leslie Knope
That is Andy Dwyer.,Leslie Knope
He is a local resident and he tragically fell in the pit.,Leslie Knope
"Uh, yeah.",Lawrence
I don't care about any of that.,Lawrence
He's the guy that plays music all night in his garage.,Lawrence
It's driving me nuts.,Lawrence
Lawrence lives with his grandma.,Andy Dwyer
Which is pretty awesome.,Andy Dwyer
"He takes care of her, I guess.",Andy Dwyer
"But whatever, he's a douchebag.",Andy Dwyer
"It's loud, it's abusive, and it's waking up my birds.",Lawrence
"You have birds, now?",Andy Dwyer
"Yeah, I have birds.",Lawrence
"I have nice, pretty, expensive birds, and you play that music, and it wakes them up.",Lawrence
"Look, I don't work for the government, okay? Uh, I do play rock and roll.",Andy Dwyer
Guilty as charged.,Andy Dwyer
I'm in a band.,Andy Dwyer
It's called Just the Tip.,Andy Dwyer
"And actually, if anyone here plays bass, we need a bassist.",Andy Dwyer
Yes.,Leslie Knope
"Okay, let's take a five-minute break, shall we?",Leslie Knope
Uh.,Ron Swanson
It is not going well at all.,Ron Swanson
Mmm-hmm.,Leslie Knope
It's going very poorly.,Ron Swanson
Okay?,Ron Swanson
Mmm-hmm.,Leslie Knope
"Like, you're crashing and burning.",Ron Swanson
Democracy's happening.,Leslie Knope
People are talking.,Leslie Knope
"I mean, at least they aren't apathetic, right?",Leslie Knope
You're right about that.,Ron Swanson
They're deeply negative.,Ron Swanson
"You need to put a happy face on this, give me a few positive talking points, and whatever you do, avoid a vote.",Ron Swanson
I'm oddly attracted to Kate Spivack.,Tom Haverford
"Before we continue, I'd love to just give you a little history of Pawnee.",Leslie Knope
"The City of Pawnee was incorporated in 1817, when a young man by the name of Reverend Luther Howell came from Terre Haute on an ox.",Leslie Knope
"He planted his flag in the ground and was met soon after by an angry tribe of Wamapoke Indians, who, when seeing the whiteness of his skin, twisted him to death.",Leslie Knope
Flash forward to 1969.,Leslie Knope
Man walks on the moon.,Leslie Knope
Pawnee is lousy with hippies--,Leslie Knope
"My, God.",Paul
She's filibustering her own meeting.,Paul
Filibuster! Boom! They can't touch you if you talk forever.,Leslie Knope
"I can't speak of the future, but I will.",Leslie Knope
"The future of Pawnee will involve us flying around in space taxis, where we will communicate on watches, and blink our feelings to each other, rather than use words.",Leslie Knope
"And now, I'd like to take a magical journey through a little something I like to call The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster.",Leslie Knope
Excuse me? Can't you read that children's book on your own time?,Kate Spivack
"I have the floor! ""There once was a boy named Milo, who didn't know what to do with himself, not just sometimes, but""",Leslie Knope
"Okay, all right.",Kate Spivack
"You know what? This is a public forum, which means that we all get to tell you what we think.",Kate Spivack
"Well, you did already talk, ma'am.",Leslie Knope
And I would love to listen to someone else.,Leslie Knope
Someone I don't know.,Leslie Knope
Uh That girl over there with the long brown hair and the yellow top.,Leslie Knope
Could you tell us how you feel about this park? Go ahead.,Leslie Knope
Hi.,April Ludgate
"Uh, I'm a youth in the community and I think a new park is a great idea.",April Ludgate
"And I fully support it, as would the rest of the youth in the community.",April Ludgate
Hey! I recognize her.,Lawrence
That kid came to my door yesterday.,Lawrence
"Oh, my God! Okay, they have planted people in this audience.",Kate Spivack
Unbelievable! You know what? We all agree that this park is a bad idea.,Kate Spivack
We should just take a vote.,Kate Spivack
Right? Yeah.,Kate Spivack
"Okay, we will take a vote.",Leslie Knope
"Before we do that, I want everyone up, lined up behind that microphone, and I want to hear from all of you.",Leslie Knope
One by one.,Leslie Knope
That was brutal.,Ann Perkins
"A couple of weeks ago, I was yelling at Leslie at a public forum.",Ann Perkins
"God, I hope I wasn't as obnoxious as those people.",Ann Perkins
"I wasn't, right?",Ann Perkins
"At 5:00 in the morning, every morning, beep, beep, beep! I don't want to hear that.",Extra
"Now, how long is this project gonna take? That's what I want to know.",Extra
That's what's important to me.,Extra
Because I need my sleep.,Extra
I put some,Extra
"Thank you, ma'am.",Leslie Knope
"Thank you, ma'am.",Leslie Knope
That concludes our meeting.,Leslie Knope
What about the vote?,Kate Spivack
We're out of time.,Leslie Knope
It's 9 o' clock.,Leslie Knope
"But we will have many public forums in the future, and we hope to see you all there.",Leslie Knope
Thank you so much for coming.,Leslie Knope
It was tough.,Leslie Knope
"But, you know, that's Pawnee.",Leslie Knope
That's democracy.,Leslie Knope
There are a lot of people here that want this park.,Leslie Knope
You just gotta get past the negative people.,Leslie Knope
But guess what? My subcommittee held its first town hall meeting tonight.,Leslie Knope
"God, I loved it! I loved every minute of it.",Leslie Knope
"Hey, park lady.",Lawrence
Yeah?,Leslie Knope
You suck.,Lawrence
"Hear that? He called me ""park lady.""",Leslie Knope
"You know, normally, I don't agree with Leslie about anything, but this book is awesome.",Tom Haverford
"Okay, now, see, here's a good example of a plant that you can't eat.",Jerry Gergich
See all the spikes?,Jerry Gergich
"So, two things.",Jerry Gergich
"One, it's poisonous.",Jerry Gergich
"And two, it would hurt.",Jerry Gergich
The Parks Department has so many programs.,Leslie Knope
Jerry's in charge of our preteen nature hikes.,Leslie Knope
"For a while, it was a teenage nature hike, but then we changed it because a girl got pregnant.",Leslie Knope
"Look what we have here, country honeysuckle, Pawnee style.",Jerry Gergich
"Yeah, take a look at that.",Jerry Gergich
Wow.,Leslie Knope
It's pretty and it smells good.,Jerry Gergich
Mmm.,Leslie Knope
Smells great.,Leslie Knope
"Yeah, it's really nice.",Jerry Gergich
Mmm.,Leslie Knope
That's bitter.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, you don't eat it.",Jerry Gergich
Oh!,Leslie Knope
Why did you let me eat that?,Leslie Knope
I never told you to eat that.,Jerry Gergich
Oh!,Leslie Knope
God.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, the animals know you don't eat the country honeysuckle.",Jerry Gergich
I'm not an animal.,Leslie Knope
My tongue is swelling up.,Leslie Knope
"No, don't touch it!",Jerry Gergich
"No, you can't-- Okay, now you'll have to throw that away.",Jerry Gergich
Let's not scare the kids.,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Jerry Gergich
All right.,Leslie Knope
All right.,Leslie Knope
"Well, there we go then.",Jerry Gergich
Let's see what else is here.,Jerry Gergich
"So let's tell them what other plants we can eat, Jerry.",Leslie Knope
"But I have to say, there's a very sweet aftertaste though.",Leslie Knope
So I have a piece of good news.,Leslie Knope
I've invited a reporter to come do an article about the pit behind your house.,Leslie Knope
"She writes for the Pawnee Journal, which is kind of like our town's Washington Post.",Leslie Knope
That sounds really good.,Ann Perkins
"Thank you, Ann.",Leslie Knope
It is a classic strategy.,Leslie Knope
The press is a weapon and you can use it to kill people or to feed people.,Leslie Knope
"You know, the beginning of projects are very vulnerable, and you have to make sure that you get a lot of press, 'cause the momentum of that can kind of keep it alive, or else it'll die.",Leslie Knope
"I mean, I'm sure you remember the Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project.",Leslie Knope
The Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project was a great idea that just ran out of steam.,Leslie Knope
"We had removed five cartoon penises, not even 10%, when we were shut down due to lack of funding.",Leslie Knope
"To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises.",Leslie Knope
One penis in particular.,Leslie Knope
"Now, when the reporter gets here, it is vital that we all follow my rules about how to deal with the media.",Leslie Knope
"Rule number one, stay on message.",Leslie Knope
This is key.,Leslie Knope
"All we need to talk about is the pit, and the fact that we're gonna turn it into a park.",Leslie Knope
And that's it.,Leslie Knope
Okay?,Leslie Knope
Number two: What?,Leslie Knope
Stay on message again?,Leslie Knope
"Yes, it's that important.",Leslie Knope
It's one and two.,Leslie Knope
Stay on message and stay on message.,Leslie Knope
Right?,Leslie Knope
"Stay on what, Ann?",Leslie Knope
Message.,Ann Perkins
Great.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie formed a committee to fill the pit in a week, which is really impressive.",Ann Perkins
"I mean, until now, my only experience with government was trying to get a recycling bin.",Ann Perkins
Wait.,Ann Perkins

So there are 10 murals here in this hallway.,Leslie Knope
"And this is called ""The trial of Chief Wamapo.""",Leslie Knope
It was painted in 1936 and this is Chief Wamapo and he was convicted of crimes against the soldiers.,Leslie Knope

Great.,Shauna Malwae-Tweep

And I fell in and broke my legs.,Andy Dwyer
Such a tragedy.,Leslie Knope
Why would you want a toaster that's lying at the bottom of the pit?,Shauna Malwae-Tweep

I was pretty wasted.,Andy Dwyer
Wait.,Ann Perkins
You were drunk?,Ann Perkins
"Oh, yeah.",Andy Dwyer
Totally.,Andy Dwyer
You knew that.,Andy Dwyer
"I didn't know that, no.",Ann Perkins
"You should've told me, because we gave you anesthesia at the hospital.",Ann Perkins

Mark.,Leslie Knope
"Listen, thank you for coming.",Leslie Knope
I tried to stay on message.,Leslie Knope
Mmmhmm.,Mark Brendanawicz
"But then, Ann and Andy sandbagged me.",Leslie Knope
Andy was drunk when he fell in the pit.,Leslie Knope
And it turns out that Ann is on birth control pills.,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Mark Brendanawicz

"Yeah, you seemed a little weird.",Shauna Malwae-Tweep

"It's just, we're trying to turn a dangerous eyesore into a beautiful community park and a positive article could go a long way towards making that happen.",Leslie Knope
Great.,Shauna Malwae-Tweep
So what do you think the odds are that this park is actually gonna get made?,Shauna Malwae-Tweep

"You did say it, right?",Shauna Malwae-Tweep

"""That park is never, ever, ever gonna get made.""",Mark Brendanawicz

And then I came back to bed.,Shauna Malwae-Tweep
"Yeah, but the important part of what I said was, ""Stay in bed.""",Mark Brendanawicz

So you're gonna blackmail her?,Ann Perkins

I was just hoping you had a moment to discuss the events at the zoo yesterday.,Marcia Langman
"Well, I have nothing to do with this, so.",Ron Swanson
"Well, what can I do for you and those fine people at the SFSF?",Leslie Knope
"Well, you could resign, if you're up for it.",Marcia Langman
"Oh, you're serious?",Leslie Knope
"When you performed a marriage for gay penguins, using taxpayer money on government property, you were symbolically taking a stand in favor of the gay marriage agenda.",Marcia Langman
"Oh, I'm sorry, but hold on a second there, Marcia.",Leslie Knope
"That was not my intention, at all.",Leslie Knope
"Well, why else would you marry penguins?",Marcia Langman
Because I firmly believed that it would be cute.,Leslie Knope
And it was.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, are you married?",Marcia Langman
No.,Leslie Knope
"Not yet, Marcia.",Leslie Knope
"Soon, probably.",Leslie Knope
"I have a plan, but, no, not now.",Leslie Knope
Not dating anyone yet.,Leslie Knope
Focusing on my career.,Leslie Knope
I thought so.,Marcia Langman
"So you couldn't possibly understand, but when gays marry, it ruins marriage for the rest of us.",Marcia Langman
"So, either you annul the wedding, or I'll publicly ask for your resignation.",Marcia Langman
You know what?,Marcia Langman
I'm so terrible with directions.,Marcia Langman
"If I'm headed to the parking lot, do I make a left out of here, or do I go right?",Marcia Langman
"It's a left, yeah.",Leslie Knope
Thank you.,Marcia Langman
You're welcome.,Leslie Knope

"And Andy, after we broke up, he told me he was going to Kansas to climb mountains.",Ann Perkins
"So, I don't really know where he is.",Ann Perkins

"Leslie, I don't want to ever keep secrets from you.",Ann Perkins

And then we can use it around people and no one will know what we're talking about.,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Ann Perkins
Okay.,Leslie Knope
"But in the meantime, I'm just gonna tell you in English.",Ann Perkins
Mark kind of asked me out.,Ann Perkins

I'm feeling a lot of confusing things right now.,Leslie Knope

And your friendship is the most important thing to me.,Ann Perkins
And he's off-limits.,Ann Perkins
Thank you.,Leslie Knope
"I just want to let you know, I was really serious about that secret language.",Leslie Knope

That Marcia Langman from the family thing is calling for your resignation.,Ron Swanson
No!,Leslie Knope
You gotta go on and defend yourself.,Ron Swanson
Why?,Leslie Knope

That's funny.,Ron Swanson
Somebody just told me you were queen of the gays.,Ron Swanson
That was me.,Leslie Knope
"Pawnee Today, with Joan Callamezzo.",Leslie Knope
It's kind of like the Meet the Press of our town.,Leslie Knope
"It's the big time, Leslie.",Tom Haverford

It is.,Leslie Knope
I'm nervous.,Leslie Knope
I just wish I were here under different circumstances.,Leslie Knope

That's sweet.,Joan Callamezzo
You'd have a treat.,Tom Haverford
You're pretty soft yourself.,Joan Callamezzo

"You keep up those funnies, I'm gonna have to invite you over for supper.",Joan Callamezzo

"Sure, yeah.",Ann Perkins
"We have a controversial topic today, the gay penguin marriage at the Pawnee Zoo.",Joan Callamezzo
"So, Marcia, what is all the fuss about?",Joan Callamezzo
"The fuss is that Miss Knope claimed that she was not advocating for this gay cause, and then that very night, she was the guest of honor at a pro-gay marriage rally at a bar called The Bulge.",Marcia Langman
"Miss Knope, how do you respond?",Joan Callamezzo
I'd first like to say that I wasn't trying to advocate for anyone.,Leslie Knope
"I did not know that both of the penguins were males, and I was just trying to perform a cute, fun ceremony to promote our local zoo.",Leslie Knope
I have to say that that stunt that you did with the penguins was clearly over the line.,Joan Callamezzo
"Now, Marcia, what, if anything, can Miss Knope do to make it right?",Joan Callamezzo
"Joan, we don't want to be unreasonable.",Marcia Langman
Of course not.,Joan Callamezzo
"We think that she should separate the penguins, annul the marriage, reimburse the taxpayers for the cost of the wedding, of course, and then resign.",Marcia Langman
Oh! Is that it?,Leslie Knope
That would do it.,Marcia Langman
Anything else? You want me to jump off a building? Perform hara-kiri?,Leslie Knope
"Move to a different town? No, I kid.",Marcia Langman
Full of ideas here today.,Joan Callamezzo
This is the reason why people don't go into politics.,Leslie Knope
"Because, I bust my ass for the people in this city, and I can't win.",Leslie Knope
"I have one night of fun with some of the best dancers I've ever danced with, and suddenly everybody's freaking out?",Leslie Knope
"Wow, look at that! Wow, we're lighting up here.",Joan Callamezzo

"But I'm really happy, and I really feel like I've matured a lot.",Andy Dwyer
Good! That's... I'm happy for you.,Ann Perkins
Yeah.,Andy Dwyer
"So listen, I was sitting in the cubicle the other day, just doing some thinking, and some growing",Andy Dwyer
And some maturing.,Ann Perkins
Yes! Maturing.,Andy Dwyer
"And darn it if I don't just miss you, and",Andy Dwyer
Andy.,Ann Perkins
"Well, A-Cakes, just let me I love you, and I'm just really sorry for the way that I treated you.",Andy Dwyer
"I was the worst boyfriend ever, I know that, and I really think it would behoove us to give it another shot.",Andy Dwyer
"Yeah, look.",Ann Perkins
"I'm really happy for you about your job and that you've learned some new words, but I'm sure about my decision.",Ann Perkins
Okay.,Andy Dwyer
Say no more.,Andy Dwyer
"Listen, hit me up on my cell phone.",Andy Dwyer
I'll be around.,Andy Dwyer
"And if you wanna talk, or grab coffee or something like that.",Andy Dwyer
Okay?,Andy Dwyer
Okay.,Ann Perkins
Oh.,Andy Dwyer
Gotta get back to the office.,Andy Dwyer
Have a good one.,Andy Dwyer
Good seeing you.,Andy Dwyer
Bye.,Ann Perkins
And the hardest part about living in this pit is probably keeping my suit pressed.,Andy Dwyer
And the rats.,Andy Dwyer
It's like a freaking rat parade every night.,Andy Dwyer
"I just want to be close to her house, because I need to protect her.",Andy Dwyer
'Cause there are some weird people that live around here.,Andy Dwyer
"Yeah, if you let penguins get married, where does it end? I mean, would you let me marry my guinea pig?",Caller
Because I really do want to marry my guinea pig.,Caller
I'll take my answer off the air.,Caller
I think that's a valuable point.,Marcia Langman
"Attendance is up 30% at the zoo, by the way.",Leslie Knope
You're welcome.,Leslie Knope
"That penguin wedding was cute, damn it.",Leslie Knope
And I'm not gonna annul it.,Leslie Knope
I'd ask you to reconsider.,Marcia Langman
"Well, I'd ask you to stop asking me, because it's not gonna happen, Marcia.",Leslie Knope
Is that right?,Marcia Langman
"Last time I checked, I don't think I murdered anyone, or had an affair, or did drugs! But I apologize.",Leslie Knope
"I apologize for having fun, and for making something cute!",Leslie Knope
Where are you from originally?,Joan Callamezzo
"Oh, no! What did I do?",Leslie Knope
"So, you will not be annulling the marriage?",Marcia Langman
No.,Leslie Knope
I will not be annulling.,Leslie Knope
No.,Leslie Knope
Look at them.,Leslie Knope
They're just in their own little penguin love bubble.,Leslie Knope
I guess that's what it's like when you meet your mate and know you're gonna be together forever.,Leslie Knope
Hi!,Ann Perkins
Hi!,Leslie Knope
You know what I realized?,Leslie Knope
What?,Ann Perkins
We're just animals.,Leslie Knope
We don't know anything about love.,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Ann Perkins
Yeah.,Leslie Knope
I think you should go on that date with Mark.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, Leslie--",Ann Perkins
"Really, seriously.",Leslie Knope
"I thought about it, and, look, he might not be my gay penguin, but he could be yours.",Leslie Knope
"Look, I told you I'm not going on a date with him.",Ann Perkins
"Okay, fine.",Leslie Knope
"If you don't want to go out with him, don't go out with him.",Leslie Knope
"But don't not do it because of me, because I'm really fine with it.",Leslie Knope
All that's important to me is that we're still friends.,Leslie Knope
"Me, too!",Ann Perkins
Good! Great.,Leslie Knope
"Plus, I already called him and told him that you were dying to go out with him, so have fun.",Leslie Knope
Huh?,Ann Perkins
"So, I transferred the penguins to a zoo in lowa.",Leslie Knope
"Gay marriage is legal there, so hopefully, they'll be happy.",Leslie Knope
At least they'll be together.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, look! Six Flags! I should take them on a water slide.",Leslie Knope
They might die.,Leslie Knope
But it would be so cute!,Leslie Knope
I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.,Ann Perkins
"Oh, my God.",Leslie Knope
"I'm so fine with it, Ann.",Leslie Knope
Seriously.,Leslie Knope

Got it.,Ann Perkins
Ovaries before brovaries.,Leslie Knope
You make such good coffee.,Leslie Knope
"Look, I know you're saying you're okay with it, but I've been in this position before, and I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't, actually.",Ann Perkins
It was kind of weird.,Ann Perkins
"But the thing is, Mark isn't my ex.",Leslie Knope
"You know, we slept together six years ago.",Leslie Knope
"Anyway, I'm over it.",Leslie Knope
Or am I?,Leslie Knope
I'm just kidding.,Leslie Knope
This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.,Leslie Knope
"A community garden, right in the middle of the pit.",Leslie Knope

"If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands.",Leslie Knope
Maybe some kind of spice?,Leslie Knope
Yeah.,Tom Haverford
"You know, Leslie, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, just roll it up into a joint and smoke it.",Tom Haverford
"Ron, did you get my texts?",Leslie Knope
No.,Ron Swanson
Did you get my emails?,Leslie Knope
Mmmmmm.,Ron Swanson
Did you see that I paged you?,Leslie Knope
I did not.,Ron Swanson

We have a criminal emergency on our hands.,Leslie Knope
Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Ron Swanson
Call the cops.,Ron Swanson
That'll leak to the press.,Leslie Knope
"Then there'll be an investigation, and they'll find my fingerprints on the manure, and then we'll lose our funding.",Leslie Knope
You don't have funding.,Ron Swanson
And we never will if this gets out.,Leslie Knope
"Look, I will call the cops, but just give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?",Leslie Knope
Sure.,Ron Swanson
Thank you.,Leslie Knope
"And listen, if this thing blows up, I was never here.",Leslie Knope
I have a hernia.,Ron Swanson

At a party in college.,Leslie Knope
It was intense.,Leslie Knope
"It was kind of indescribable, actually.",Leslie Knope
I felt like I was floating.,Leslie Knope
Turns out there wasn't any pot in the brownie.,Leslie Knope
It was just an insanely good brownie.,Leslie Knope
"You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal.",Leslie Knope
"Cause we flip the headline, and it's not ""Community Garden Infested With Pot.""",Leslie Knope
"It's ""Brave Public Servants Rid Neighborhood of Drugs, Earn Praise from Mayor, comma, Everyone.""",Leslie Knope

"Oh, by the way, completely unrelated, I just signed up for the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant.",April Ludgate
That's wonderful.,Leslie Knope
"You know, that is why I decided to become a judge.",Leslie Knope
"So that awesome girls like you, who are not, you know, classically hot, can be rewarded for their intelligence and savvy.",Leslie Knope
Beauty pageants are idiotic.,April Ludgate
But I found out that the winner of the Miss Pawnee Pageant gets 600 dollars.,April Ludgate
I can be idiotic for 600 dollars.,April Ludgate

I think it's a real shame when people focus on the tawdry details of a scandal.,Leslie Knope

Okay.,Leslie Knope
This is our thermometer!,Leslie Knope

I do not understand.,Raul
You've never had a budget shortage?,Leslie Knope
No.,Elvis
Venezuela is blessed with massive oil reserves.,Raul

It's huge.,Raul
Lady Gaga played there last week.,Elvis

We were very tired from our long journey.,Raul
"Also, we were a bit jealous.",Elvis
Our colleagues from Caracas are visiting their sister city of Miami.,Elvis

Maybe I should return the money.,Leslie Knope
"It's from a foreign government, I don't really trust these guys.",Leslie Knope
I'm gonna return the money.,Leslie Knope
Are you crazy? You could buy a low-end Lexus with that money.,Tom Haverford
"Or, you could build a park with that money.",Ann Perkins
Let's look at the pros and cons.,Leslie Knope
"Pro, we could fill in the pit and build a park.",Ann Perkins
"Con, we might be filling it in with dirty money.",Leslie Knope
"Pro, 35,000 dollars worth of dirty money.",Tom Haverford
"Con, not quite sure why that's a pro.",Leslie Knope
"Pro, we can fill in the pit.",Mark Brendanawicz

It is Hugo Chavez's passion project.,Raul
And we just had an idea.,Raul

"And you can have a nice, big fountain of his head, so that when the water is coming out he is spitting at you all the time.",Raul
You should write this down.,Raul

You have offended us.,Raul
You have offended the government of Boraqua.,Raul
You are no longer our sister.,Raul
"No, America is not perfect.",Leslie Knope
But diplomacy isn't just sucking up and being a pushover.,Leslie Knope
Sometimes you got to get tough.,Leslie Knope
"I am gonna build that park myself, and it is gonna be awesome.",Leslie Knope
And it's not gonna have a fountain shaped like Hugo Chavez's head spitting water all over everyone.,Leslie Knope
Unless that's what the people want.,Leslie Knope
"And that, sir, is democracy.",Leslie Knope
"Leslie, come see this!",Tom Haverford

High five!,Keef
High five!,Keef
High five!,Keef
I never trust anything that comes that quickly.,Leslie Knope
That's why I don't eat Minute Rice.,Leslie Knope
"So this whole ""build a playground in a day"" thing, I mean, that's just a slogan, right?",Leslie Knope
Nope.,Keef
"One day, 24 hours.",Keef
"Keef, that is so incredible.",Leslie Knope
"I mean, I work in Parks, and I know how hard it is to get something done.",Leslie Knope
Not if you have the Kaboom spirit.,Keef
"You can look at a problem, and you can either go, ""Oh, this is a problem"" or you can kaboom, blow it up and turn it into something great.",Keef
You literally kaboom the problem.,Keef

That's the spirit.,Leslie Knope
"There it is, the pit.",Ann Perkins
Hmm.,Leslie Knope
There's something I wish I could kaboom.,Ann Perkins

It's just a slow boom.,Leslie Knope
"A slower, more deliberate kaboom.",Leslie Knope
Yeah.,Ann Perkins
Totally.,Ann Perkins
See you tomorrow.,Ann Perkins
Okay.,Leslie Knope
You know what this mess is?,Leslie Knope
This is a list of things we have to complete before we fill in the pit behind Ann's house.,Leslie Knope
You know what this is?,Leslie Knope
This is a kaboomer.,Leslie Knope
"Jerry, did you use permanent marker again?",Leslie Knope
"I'm sorry, guys, I I just grabbed the wrong--",Jerry Gergich
This is a big--,Leslie Knope
I grabbed the wrong--,Jerry Gergich
"This is gonna open very big, Jerry.",Leslie Knope

And this is clean.,Leslie Knope
How do we speed up the process?,Leslie Knope

"Something more plausible than that, but fast.",Leslie Knope
Would you break the rules?,Mark Brendanawicz
I won't murder.,Leslie Knope

What should I do?,Leslie Knope
Mmm.,Ann Perkins
"You should do it, and you should ask your friend to help you, because your friend totally has your back.",Ann Perkins
And that friend is me.,Ann Perkins
You'll help me?,Leslie Knope
"Of course, I'll do anything I can to help.",Ann Perkins
Let's do it.,Ann Perkins

"All I'm gonna do is go in and just say, ""We are so sorry, it's entirely our fault""",Leslie Knope
"No, no, no, no.",Scott Braddock
You can't say any of that.,Scott Braddock
It admits liability.,Scott Braddock
"You can't say ""I'm sorry,"" or ""I apologize.""",Scott Braddock
It implies guilt.,Scott Braddock
That's insane.,Leslie Knope
I have to apologize.,Leslie Knope
Andy was a victim--,Leslie Knope
"Can't say ""victim.""",Scott Braddock
Of an extremely unfortunate situation.,Leslie Knope

"Leslie, the man lived in a pit.",Ann Perkins
Okay?,Ann Perkins
"He couldn't find a place to live on the Earth's surface, so he went under the ground.",Ann Perkins

What did you mean when you said this was your only option?,Leslie Knope
"Well, I'm completely broke, and my lawyer said it could be worth upwards of 100,000 dollars.",Andy Dwyer
I just can't believe that you're suing just for the money.,Leslie Knope
"I want Ann back, and she said she really needs a guy with a lot of money.",Andy Dwyer
That doesn't sound like Ann.,Leslie Knope
"Well, I can't really do her voice, but she said she likes Mark because he's a grown-up with a bank account.",Andy Dwyer
I put two and two together.,Andy Dwyer
"100,000 dollars, I could probably get a bank account.",Andy Dwyer
"Sometimes, I think the right thing to do is to not take shortcuts.",Leslie Knope
"I mean, look, I tried to fill in the pit, that didn't work either.",Leslie Knope
Fine.,Andy Dwyer
I'll get a job.,Andy Dwyer
Ann will respect that.,Andy Dwyer
I can make six bucks a day playing guitar on the street.,Andy Dwyer

What's it gonna take?,Scott Braddock
"One, I want that pit filled in, sir.",Andy Dwyer
Is there a two?,Scott Braddock
"A guaranteed starting spot in the Indianapolis Colts, inside linebacker.",Andy Dwyer
"Well, we can't accomplish that.",Scott Braddock
"I think that Andy seems like he doesn't care so much about the second one, and he would be fine with us just filling in the pit.",Leslie Knope
"What do you say, Scott?",Leslie Knope
Yeah.,Scott Braddock
"I mean, eventually, we're gonna fill in the pit.",Scott Braddock
"""Eventually""?",Andy Dwyer
I've already been injured in that thing twice.,Andy Dwyer
"And I could fall in 10 more times by ""eventually.""",Andy Dwyer
"Every time I walk past that pit, I'm forced to relive the most traumatic two separate days of my life, and wanna sue you again.",Andy Dwyer

Yeah.,Scott Braddock
This is really happening.,Ann Perkins
I just can't believe it.,Ann Perkins
"Oh, sorry.",Leslie Knope
"Usually, in these situations, a person says ""pinch me.""",Leslie Knope
Is that Andy?,Ann Perkins
"Ah, yeah.",Leslie Knope
"Just one of his conditions for the settlement, I guess.",Leslie Knope
He settled?,Ann Perkins

Every Halloween someone defaces the statue of Mayor Percy in Ramsett Park.,Leslie Knope
"And I know it's Greg Pikitis, but I've never been able to prove it.",Leslie Knope
"He's like an invisible, adolescent, James Bond super villain criminal mastermind.",Leslie Knope
"Or maybe someone else is doing it, but I really feel like it's this kid.",Leslie Knope
"I've got the entire Parks Department watching you, my boyfriend's a cop, so don't even try it.",Leslie Knope
I don't know what you're talking about.,Greg Pikitis

Yes.,Greg's Mom

"Does he have a lookalike or something? Did he have an accomplice? I mean, did he have help? How did that little turd do it?",Leslie Knope

"Well, I've been listening to your boring speeches for the last 50 years, and now it's time for you to listen to one of mine.",Old Gus
"You know, a day like this makes a man reflect upon his life, and I've come to the conclusion that I've completely wasted mine.",Old Gus
"And just for the record, I never ever liked being called ""Old Gus.""",Old Gus
"I didn't understand it when I was in my 20s, and I sure hate it now.",Old Gus
"So go to hell, every single one of you.",Old Gus

The library?,Leslie Knope
"Pawnee's library department is the most diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats I've ever seen.",Leslie Knope

Thanks for pulling me out of there.,Leslie Knope

"News flash, we're screwed.",Leslie Knope
We got a big problem with the library.,Leslie Knope
Punkass book jockeys.,Tom Haverford

I have to go talk to her.,Leslie Knope
And you got to give me something I can use.,Leslie Knope
Does she have any weaknesses?,Leslie Knope
No.,Ron Swanson
"What do you mean, no?",Leslie Knope
Everybody has a weakness.,Leslie Knope
Not machines.,Ron Swanson
I honestly believe that she was programmed by someone from the future to come back and destroy all happiness.,Ron Swanson
I see.,Leslie Knope
"I knew that you had two ex-wives named Tammy, so I was hoping that there was one that you got along with and--",Leslie Knope
Nope.,Ron Swanson

Would I get married again?,Ron Swanson
"Oh, absolutely.",Ron Swanson
"If you don't believe in love, what's the point of living?",Ron Swanson

"I should have known you'd use a low blow, dirty pool BS move like that.",Leslie Knope
No--,Tammy 2
That's why everybody hates the library.,Leslie Knope
Here.,Leslie Knope
You know what?,Leslie Knope
Here's your 3 dollars.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, no--",Tammy 2
And I'll see you in hell.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, Leslie, Leslie.",Tammy 2
I'm just kidding.,Tammy 2
"My gosh, I mean, you did have 3 dollars worth of fines, but I cleared them.",Tammy 2

You want those shoes shined?,Andy Dwyer
I'll give you a discount because you're a friend of Ann's.,Andy Dwyer

Wow.,Tammy 2
"If I'd had a park like that when I was growing up, I probably wouldn't have gone through such a prolonged mall slut phase.",Tammy 2
"Well, that's the goal, Tammy.",Leslie Knope
"Listen, you guys got there first.",Tammy 2
"I'm gonna withdraw my request for the lot, as a professional courtesy to you.",Tammy 2
"Government gals, right?",Tammy 2

"So, Tammy, for that and many other reasons, Ron has decided to end this relationship.",Leslie Knope
Wait a minute.,Tammy 2
Ron brought you here to break up with me for him?,Tammy 2
She volunteered.,Ron Swanson
"Leslie, Ron doesn't wanna break up with me.",Tammy 2
"What Ron wants to do is leave here right now, go to the sleaziest motel in town, and wrap himself around me like a coiled snake.",Tammy 2
"No, he doesn't.",Leslie Knope
I'm pretty sure he does.,Tammy 2
See?,Leslie Knope
He's completely over you.,Leslie Knope
"Look, I understand that this Ann situation is awkward.",Mark Brendanawicz
But I like you a lot as a dude.,Mark Brendanawicz
"And I just hope that there is some way that we can both be mature, and maybe be friends.",Mark Brendanawicz
Yeah.,Andy Dwyer
I doubt it.,Andy Dwyer
"I mean, I think you're a cool dude, too.",Andy Dwyer
I like you as well.,Andy Dwyer
But I'm still in love with Ann.,Andy Dwyer
I couldn't have been more upfront about that.,Andy Dwyer
Is punching allowed on the high road?,Mark Brendanawicz
"I'm sorry, Leslie.",Ron Swanson
She wins.,Ron Swanson
I can't resist her.,Ron Swanson
"God, Ron, you have to.",Leslie Knope
Stay out of this.,Tammy 2
This is our relationship.,Tammy 2
He's my man.,Tammy 2
And we have something twisted and beautiful.,Tammy 2
Oh.,Tammy 2
You want Ron.,Tammy 2
That's what this is all about.,Tammy 2
No.,Leslie Knope
That's insane.,Leslie Knope
"Fine, I had one dream.",Leslie Knope
"But no, no.",Leslie Knope
"Baby, don't you see what's happening here? She's manipulating you because she's jealous of me, and the things I get to do to your body and face.",Tammy 2
"I'm here because Ron is my friend, and I don't like seeing my friends miserable.",Leslie Knope
"And you, Tammy, you make him miserable.",Leslie Knope
"So, Ron, you can give her the lot, or don't, whatever.",Leslie Knope
"Just, please, find a way to be happy.",Leslie Knope
Knope.,Ron Swanson
Wait.,Ron Swanson
"Ron, it's okay.",Leslie Knope
Just sign the thing.,Leslie Knope
"No, Leslie, it's not okay.",Ron Swanson
You just put my needs in front of your own.,Ron Swanson
No woman has ever done that for me before.,Ron Swanson
I'm sure that's not true.,Leslie Knope
"You see the kind of women that I choose, right? Look, just wait for me downstairs.",Ron Swanson
"If I'm not down in five minutes, it's only because I'm receiving a pleasure so intense--",Ron Swanson
"Oh, my God.",Leslie Knope
"What the hell are you doing? ""Andy and Ann's Family Shoeshine""?",Ann Perkins
"Andy, Ann, I thought it had a nice ring to it.",Andy Dwyer
"Oh, my God.",Ann Perkins
"Look, Mark has been really cool about all this, and you're throwing it in his face.",Ann Perkins
"Look, I still have feelings for you.",Andy Dwyer
Okay? I said it.,Andy Dwyer
What do you want me to do? Not mention those feelings to your boyfriend?,Andy Dwyer
Yes.,Ann Perkins
Yes.,Mark Brendanawicz
And you might wanna take these pictures down.,Mark Brendanawicz
"Oh, my God.",Ann Perkins
Take those pictures down.,Ann Perkins
What? Fine.,Andy Dwyer
All of it.,Ann Perkins
I'm gonna.,Andy Dwyer
Now.,Ann Perkins
"Oh, my God.",Ann Perkins
Give me the bikini one.,Ann Perkins
The teeny one?,Andy Dwyer
Bikini one.,Ann Perkins
You didn't give her the lot.,Leslie Knope
Let's get out of here.,Ron Swanson
Is part of your mustache missing?,Leslie Knope
Yes.,Ron Swanson
Just keep walking.,Ron Swanson
There's a push-pin in your face.,Leslie Knope
Leave it in.,Ron Swanson
Can't you walk faster?,Ron Swanson
My legs are shorter than yours.,Leslie Knope
Mmm.,Ron Swanson
We had a good run.,Ron Swanson
Thank you for saving my future park.,Leslie Knope
I know that must've been hard for you.,Leslie Knope
"You didn't kill Tammy, did you?",Leslie Knope
I'm afraid she can't be killed.,Ron Swanson
To exes.,Ron Swanson
May they always stay that way.,Ron Swanson
Tammy is a mean person.,Ron Swanson
"Come on, Ron.",Leslie Knope
You can do better than that.,Leslie Knope
She's a grade A bitch.,Ron Swanson
There we go.,Leslie Knope
"Every time she laughs, an angel dies.",Ron Swanson
Even telemarketers avoid her.,Ron Swanson
Her birth was payback for the sins of man.,Ron Swanson
But you know the worst thing about her?,Ron Swanson
She works for the library.,Leslie Knope
She works for the library.,Ron Swanson
Okay.,Paul
"As everybody knows, The Spirit of Pawnee was defaced again last night.",Paul
What was it this time?,Leslie Knope
Chocolate pudding.,Paul
Huh.,Leslie Knope
That's new.,Leslie Knope
The mural that normally resides here is called The Spirit of Pawnee.,Leslie Knope
And it's very controversial.,Leslie Knope
"We've had someone throw acid at it, tomato sauce.",Leslie Knope
Someone tried to stab it once.,Leslie Knope
We really need better security here.,Leslie Knope
"We also need better, less offensive history.",Leslie Knope
"So, the city council has decided that The Spirit of Pawnee should be changed to something just a little less horrifying.",Paul
"Now, since the murals were made by government employees back in the 1930s, we thought it might be fun if each department submitted a design for a new mural.",Paul
And you'll submit your concepts tomorrow afternoon.,Paul
"All righty, folks?",Paul
Thank you very much.,Paul
"Hey, Leslie.",Joe From Sewage
What's your design going to be?,Joe From Sewage
A tree?,Joe From Sewage
"Joe, you work in Sewage.",Leslie Knope
Your department literally specializes in crap.,Leslie Knope
You really want to do this?,Leslie Knope
I told you before.,Joe From Sewage
"""Crap"" is a slang term.",Joe From Sewage
And I don't like that term.,Joe From Sewage
"But at least we don't specialize in losing, like you guys.",Joe From Sewage
Sewage.,Joe From Sewage
Let's roll.,Joe From Sewage
Damn!,Tom Haverford
How does Sewage always get the hottest interns?,Tom Haverford
"Guys, this department has the chance to design something that could be in this building forever.",Leslie Knope
This could be our legacy.,Leslie Knope
I thought building a park on Lot 48 was going to be our legacy.,Ann Perkins
"Well, you can have two legacies.",Leslie Knope
Look at Madonna.,Leslie Knope
"Great singer, amazing arms.",Leslie Knope
Look at O.J. Simpson.,Tom Haverford
"Heisman Trophy winner, Naked Gun.",Tom Haverford
Mmmhmm.,Leslie Knope
"No offense, Leslie, but I'm not an artist.",Donna Meagle
"Oh, that's not true, Donna.",Leslie Knope
I've seen your fingernails.,Leslie Knope
"Um, I pay someone to do this.",Donna Meagle
Really?,Leslie Knope
"Oh, well, shoot.",Leslie Knope
"Anyway, I'm ordering all of you to design a mural.",Leslie Knope
"Uh, only Ron can order the whole department to do something.",Tom Haverford
Ron?,Leslie Knope
Order them to do this.,Leslie Knope
Do whatever Leslie says.,Ron Swanson
Okay.,Leslie Knope
"So, here are your supplies.",Leslie Knope
I want you to go and find the spirit of Pawnee.,Leslie Knope
And make me a sketch.,Leslie Knope
And it needs to be breath-taking and moving and historical and better than every department.,Leslie Knope
And you have one hour.,Leslie Knope
Designers.,Leslie Knope
Make it work.,Leslie Knope
Tim Gunn.,Leslie Knope
"You, my friend, are ready to go dancing.",Andy Dwyer
"Thank you, sir.",Andy Dwyer
All right.,Andy Dwyer
Next?,Andy Dwyer
Andrew.,Ron Swanson
Looking good.,Ron Swanson
Business is booming.,Ron Swanson
Yeah.,Andy Dwyer
Hey.,Andy Dwyer
"Ron, how about you?",Andy Dwyer
Need a little dog waxing?,Andy Dwyer
"It's only 5 bucks, and I'll let you cut in front of this guy.",Andy Dwyer
What?,Kyle
Come on.,Andy Dwyer
Beat it.,Andy Dwyer
This is Ron Swanson we're talking about.,Andy Dwyer
I'm impressed with Andy.,Ron Swanson
Pulling himself up by his bootstraps.,Ron Swanson
He reminds me of me.,Ron Swanson
I got my first job when I was nine.,Ron Swanson
Worked at a sheet metal factory.,Ron Swanson
"In two weeks, I was running the floor.",Ron Swanson
Child labor laws are ruining this country.,Ron Swanson
Do you have a key in your shoe?,Andy Dwyer
No.,Ron Swanson
"No, I have a bunion that's practically its own toe.",Ron Swanson
"Normally, the pain howls through my loafers like a banshee on the moors.",Ron Swanson
"But for these past three minutes, it's been reduced to a faint growl.",Ron Swanson
Okay.,Andy Dwyer
That was neat.,Andy Dwyer
"Well, hey.",Andy Dwyer
We are all finished.,Andy Dwyer
"Well, that was great.",Ron Swanson
"Thank you, son.",Ron Swanson
No sweat.,Andy Dwyer
Next?,Andy Dwyer
You shouldn't let your friends cut in line.,Kyle
It's not good business.,Kyle
You want to know what else isn't good business?,Andy Dwyer
That guy's my friend.,Andy Dwyer
Right.,Kyle
I'm saying you shouldn't let your friends cut in line.,Kyle
All right.,Andy Dwyer
Sorry Kyle.,Andy Dwyer
Here.,Andy Dwyer
Give me this.,Andy Dwyer
Next.,Andy Dwyer
"So, what are you looking for exactly?",Artist
"I don't know, man.",Tom Haverford
"""The spirit of Pawnee.""",Tom Haverford
That's all I got.,Tom Haverford
Here.,Tom Haverford
Just give me 20 dollars worth of art.,Tom Haverford
"Just something that seems personal, that only I could have done.",Tom Haverford
Tell me about yourself.,Artist
No.,Tom Haverford
Just paint.,Tom Haverford
I have no interest in art.,Tom Haverford
Let me clarify.,Tom Haverford
I have no interest in non-nude images.,Tom Haverford
"Dude, what the hell kind of art is this?",Tom Haverford
It looks like a lizard puking up Skittles.,Tom Haverford
I'm an abstract expressionist.,Artist
"No, you're a con artist.",Tom Haverford
And I'm a guy that's out 20 bucks.,Tom Haverford
Ugh.,Tom Haverford
Whatever.,Tom Haverford
I'm a terrible artist.,Ann Perkins
"But the Parks Department has done so much for me that if I can help them out in any way, I will.",Ann Perkins
"Oh, God.",Ann Perkins
Maybe I should just give them all free flu shots.,Ann Perkins
I know everything about this town and these murals.,Leslie Knope
And that's why this is a dream come true.,Leslie Knope
Literally.,Leslie Knope
I have had a dream where I designed a mural.,Leslie Knope
"But then it turned into a nightmare, because the mural started talking, and it came alive and it was whispering.",Leslie Knope
"And I couldn't hear what it was saying, so I leaned in close, and then it ate me.",Leslie Knope
"At one point, Gina Gershon was there.",Leslie Knope
My piece is truly going to capture the spirit of Pawnee.,April Ludgate
"I never understood the term ""elbow grease.""",Andy Dwyer
I guess it's not really grease.,Andy Dwyer
Just hard work.,Andy Dwyer
"Oh, hey, Ron.",Andy Dwyer
"Nice, shiny shoes you got there.",Andy Dwyer
"Oh, hey.",Ron Swanson
"I was just, I thinkâ¦",Ron Swanson
"Oh, no.",Ron Swanson
Shoot.,Ron Swanson
"Actually, it looks like I scuffed this one.",Ron Swanson
"Do you need your money back, Ron?",Andy Dwyer
Because I already spent it.,Andy Dwyer
Really?,Ron Swanson
How did... Never mind.,Ron Swanson
I think I'll just take another full polish.,Ron Swanson
Can I cut in line again?,Ron Swanson
I feel right at home as a shoe shiner.,Andy Dwyer
"I have no idea what I'm doing, but I know I'm doing it really, really well.",Andy Dwyer
Okay!,Leslie Knope
Let's get going with the spirit of Pawnee.,Leslie Knope
"Ann, you go first.",Leslie Knope
Okay.,Ann Perkins
Um... Okay.,Ann Perkins
"Well, since it's the Parks Department, I thought I would design a pretty park.",Ann Perkins
With dogs playing.,Ann Perkins
"And I can't really draw, so I just cut some stuff out of a magazine.",Ann Perkins
That looks like something a death row convict would make in art therapy.,Tom Haverford
"Dude, I tried.",Ann Perkins
And you failed.,Tom Haverford
It's dogs and people playing in a park.,Ann Perkins
It's cute.,Ann Perkins
"It's okay, sweetheart.",Tom Haverford
"You can't make art, because you are art.",Tom Haverford
You're beautiful.,Tom Haverford
But that sucks.,Tom Haverford
Okay.,Ann Perkins
Let's see yours.,Ann Perkins
Fine.,Tom Haverford
Mine is amazing.,Tom Haverford
It's going to blow your mind.,Tom Haverford
Okay.,Tom Haverford
This is some professional-ass art right here.,Tom Haverford
I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at.,Leslie Knope
"It's abstract, Leslie.",Tom Haverford
"Over here, you've got some shapes.",Tom Haverford
"And then you come over to this side... You know, it's actually kind of interesting.",Tom Haverford
Each shape is its own thing.,Tom Haverford
"But then when it comes together, it really gives you a sense of... completion.",Tom Haverford
Hmm.,Tom Haverford
A piece of art caused me to have an emotional reaction.,Tom Haverford
Is that normal?,Tom Haverford
"So, it's the Last Supper, but with famous people from Indiana.",Donna Meagle
"John Mellencamp, Larry Bird, Michael Jackson, uh, David Letterman, Vivica A. Fox.",Donna Meagle
"Okay, so, here's where it gets a little dicey.",Donna Meagle
Because there's not that many celebrities from Indiana.,Donna Meagle
"So, a NASCAR.",Donna Meagle
"Uh, my friend, Becky.",Donna Meagle
Ron Swanson.,Donna Meagle
Donna?,Leslie Knope
Who's the Jesus?,Leslie Knope
That would be Greg Kinnear.,Donna Meagle
I didn't know he was from Indiana.,Leslie Knope
"Yeah, you know, I read that he was.",Ann Perkins
Oh.,Leslie Knope
Do you think he's the best choice for Jesus?,Leslie Knope
"I mean, he was great on ER.",Leslie Knope
Greg Kinnear wasn't in ER.,Tom Haverford
"Yeah, he was.",Leslie Knope
I don't think that he was.,Ann Perkins
Who am I thinking of?,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Leslie Knope
Next?,Leslie Knope
Wow.,Leslie Knope
"Really good, Jerry.",Leslie Knope
"For my murinal, I was inspired by the death of my grandma.",Jerry Gergich
"You said ""murinal.""",Tom Haverford
"She... No, I didn't.",Jerry Gergich
"Yes, you did.",Ann Perkins
"You said ""murinal.""",Ann Perkins
I heard it.,Ann Perkins
"Anyway, she--",Jerry Gergich
Jerry.,April Ludgate
Why don't you put that murinal in the men's room so people can murinate all over it?,April Ludgate
Jerry.,Tom Haverford
Go to the doctor.,Tom Haverford
You might have a murinary tract infection.,Tom Haverford
I just wanted to show you my art.,Jerry Gergich
Murinal!,Tom Haverford
Murinal!,Tom Haverford
Murinal!,Tom Haverford
Disqualified!,Leslie Knope
It's pointillism.,Jerry Gergich
And each dot is a photo of a citizen of the town.,Jerry Gergich
No one cares.,Tom Haverford
At all.,Tom Haverford
Okay.,April Ludgate
"So, this is a multimedia project.",April Ludgate
"First, a bunch of rats made out of garbage.",April Ludgate
And this is a TV screen.,April Ludgate
"It'll be like a big, flatscreen TV, and it will play looped video of knee surgeries.",April Ludgate
And then this is a human-sized hamster wheel that will be next to the mural if we can get one.,April Ludgate
"And it will be spinning and there will be, like, a fat guy in it all the time, like, screaming and, like, eating raw beef and, like, bleeding.",April Ludgate
"And, like, blood will, like, come out of his mouth and stuff.",April Ludgate
"And that'll be, like, right next to the mural.",April Ludgate
I have one question.,Leslie Knope
Why?,Leslie Knope
"If you have to ask, you don't get it.",April Ludgate
I don't think they really got the assignment.,Leslie Knope
"If we're gonna beat all the other departments, we have to choose something that will stand the test of time.",Leslie Knope
Like the Mona Lisa.,Leslie Knope
Or the music of Squeeze.,Leslie Knope
"June 8, 1922.",Leslie Knope
The Pawnee Bread Factory burned to the ground.,Leslie Knope
We lost a lot of good bread that day.,Leslie Knope
As well as several human lives.,Leslie Knope
And it also made the whole town smell like toast.,Leslie Knope
"Which one resident described as ""disturbingly enticing.""",Leslie Knope
But I digress.,Leslie Knope
The point is we rebuilt Pawnee to the wonderful town that it is today.,Leslie Knope
Why would you want a mural that shows people dying when you could have shapes that come alive?,Tom Haverford
"Well, because it's the most famous event in our town's history.",Leslie Knope
And people love voting for tragedy.,Leslie Knope
Look at the Oscars.,Leslie Knope
This is our Holocaust movie.,Leslie Knope
"This is our ""English Patient.""",Leslie Knope
It sounds like you're exploiting the tragedy.,Ann Perkins
"See, Ann gets it.",Leslie Knope
Okay.,Leslie Knope
"Time to vote, everybody.",Leslie Knope
Cast your votes.,Leslie Knope
"May the best, most tragic project win.",Leslie Knope
"When we started this, we were six different voices with six ideas for a mural.",Leslie Knope
And then those six voices came together as a team.,Leslie Knope
There are no losers today.,Leslie Knope
"But there is one winner, us.",Leslie Knope
The Parks Department.,Leslie Knope
"Tom, the results of the vote, please.",Leslie Knope
One to one to one to one to one to one.,Tom Haverford
"We all voted for ourselves, didn't we?",Leslie Knope
Yeah.,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Leslie Knope
Third time today.,Andy Dwyer
Mmm.,Ron Swanson
That's a good shoeshine.,Ron Swanson
What the [bleep] man?,Andy Dwyer
I I don't know what happened.,Ron Swanson
Frankly.,Ron Swanson
I emitted a noise.,Ron Swanson
The noise was involuntary.,Ron Swanson
"Sometimes, a sound is just a sound.",Ron Swanson
You know?,Ron Swanson
We need to whittle these down.,Leslie Knope
Can we all agree on eliminating any of these designs?,Leslie Knope
Ann's blows.,April Ludgate
Wow.,Ann Perkins
Don't hold back.,Ann Perkins
"No offense, but it's a giant picture of a park.",April Ludgate
That's not art.,April Ludgate
"Well, at least it's not a fat human hamster eating meat.",Ann Perkins
You don't even work here.,April Ludgate
"Okay, guys, you both have a point.",Leslie Knope
"Ann, yours was a little trite.",Leslie Knope
"And April, yours was hellish and might make someone vomit.",Leslie Knope
Thank you.,April Ludgate
"Look, there's something about those shapes.",Tom Haverford
There's some emotional art right there.,Tom Haverford
Any kid could do that.,April Ludgate
No kid could do that.,Tom Haverford
Only God could do that.,Tom Haverford
What is so great about the shapes?,Donna Meagle
"He likes the shapes, okay?",Leslie Knope
And he's part of the team.,Leslie Knope
"So, here.",Leslie Knope
Take these scissors and cut out your favorite shapes.,Leslie Knope
And then we'll put them on a new team mural.,Leslie Knope
We're going to make a new design that takes the best parts of all of our designs.,Leslie Knope
It's like if you got Michelangelo and Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock and Jim Davis from Garfield to do one painting.,Leslie Knope
Imagine how good that painting would be.,Leslie Knope
I think it's really good.,Leslie Knope
I'll be right back.,Leslie Knope
Brendanawicz!,Leslie Knope
We need you for something.,Leslie Knope
Can it wait?,Mark Brendanawicz
I am so swamped here.,Mark Brendanawicz
Ann's in trouble.,Leslie Knope
We think it might be pills.,Leslie Knope
What?,Mark Brendanawicz
No.,Leslie Knope
That's a lie.,Leslie Knope
But this is just as important.,Leslie Knope
We need you to look at a piece of art.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, God.",Mark Brendanawicz
What is that?,Mark Brendanawicz
This is our entry for the mural contest.,Leslie Knope
"We couldn't decide on one design, so we took parts that we all liked of our designs, and then we just kind of smushed it into a thing.",Leslie Knope
"Well, you made a camel.",Mark Brendanawicz
You've never heard that saying?,Mark Brendanawicz
The camel was actually a horse designed by a committee.,Mark Brendanawicz
And what you guys have here is one ugly camel.,Mark Brendanawicz
Featuring Bill Paxton.,Mark Brendanawicz
Greg Kinnear.,Donna Meagle
Right.,Mark Brendanawicz
Greg Kinnear.,Mark Brendanawicz
Oh!,Donna Meagle
Is Bill Paxton from Indiana?,Donna Meagle
You have to save us.,Leslie Knope
You have to design something.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, I'm not an artist.",Mark Brendanawicz
"Yes, you are.",Leslie Knope
I've seen you sketch things.,Leslie Knope
"Uh, yeah, like poles for stop signs.",Mark Brendanawicz
That everybody stops and looks at.,Leslie Knope
"By law, Leslie.",Mark Brendanawicz
They're required to.,Mark Brendanawicz
"Look, Mark.",Leslie Knope
Please.,Leslie Knope
You're the only one of us who's actually got any talent.,Leslie Knope
I know you'll do something good.,Leslie Knope
"And I really, really want to win this.",Leslie Knope
Please?,Leslie Knope
What are you going to do tonight?,Leslie Knope
I was going to go to Arby's and watch Frontline.,Mark Brendanawicz
Okay.,Leslie Knope
Here we go.,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Mark Brendanawicz
"So, it is an old man feeding pigeons in a park.",Mark Brendanawicz
Uh... The spirit of Pawnee?,Mark Brendanawicz
Maybe?,Mark Brendanawicz
You got to be kidding me.,Tom Haverford
How is that better than my park scene?,Ann Perkins
It isn't.,April Ludgate
And that's saying something.,April Ludgate
And who's the man?,Donna Meagle
Is he famous?,Donna Meagle
Is it Martin Landau?,Donna Meagle
"Look, I have no dog in this fight.",Mark Brendanawicz
I'm just saying that this will win.,Mark Brendanawicz
It's nothing.,Tom Haverford
It's mush.,Tom Haverford
"There's not even one shape in there, Mark.",Tom Haverford
Where are the shapes?,Tom Haverford
I'm not saying that this is any good.,Mark Brendanawicz
I'm saying that this will win.,Mark Brendanawicz
It's mass appeal.,Mark Brendanawicz
"It's like what motels put up, and it hangs there for years, and no one ever throws acid at it.",Mark Brendanawicz
Mmm.,Ron Swanson
Who did this?,Ron Swanson
I like it.,Ron Swanson
Seriously?,Ann Perkins
I mean... Sorry.,Ann Perkins
Yeah.,Ron Swanson
It comforts me.,Ron Swanson
That'll win.,Ron Swanson
This is garbage.,Tom Haverford
We've got to go back to the shapes.,Tom Haverford
No.,April Ludgate
This is boring.,April Ludgate
We got to go back to the garbage.,April Ludgate
I would take the shapes over this.,Ann Perkins
"I mean, come on.",Ann Perkins
I wouldn't take the shapes over anything.,Donna Meagle
I'd take Jerry's murinal over this.,Donna Meagle
"No, guys.",Leslie Knope
This is the one.,Leslie Knope
What?,Tom Haverford
Sorry.,Leslie Knope
Mark's right.,Leslie Knope
This is an outrage.,Tom Haverford
Mark's not even in the department.,Tom Haverford
Right.,Ann Perkins
Neither is Ann.,Mark Brendanawicz
But Ann's hot.,Tom Haverford
And that counts for something.,Tom Haverford
"Whatever happened to, ""We're the Parks Department!""",April Ludgate
"""Rah rah rah!""",April Ludgate
"""Down with the Sewage Department!""",April Ludgate
"Yeah, we spent all day here for no reason.",Ann Perkins
We have a reason.,Leslie Knope
We're going to win.,Leslie Knope
That's our reason.,Leslie Knope
Our designs are not going to win.,Leslie Knope
Mark's might win.,Leslie Knope
"How great would it be if we won, you guys?",Leslie Knope
"You'll feel a lot better, I promise you, after you win.",Leslie Knope
We're going with this one.,Leslie Knope
All right.,Leslie Knope
I'll see you at the presentation tomorrow.,Leslie Knope
"That is an order, team.",Leslie Knope
Go team!,Leslie Knope
Team dismissed.,Leslie Knope
"Yes, we are a team.",Leslie Knope
But I am the team leader.,Leslie Knope
"So, I made a bold decision.",Leslie Knope
We're playing it safe.,Leslie Knope
"Hey, Knope.",Joe From Sewage
How's life in the Parks Defartment?,Joe From Sewage
Better than life in the Sewage Defartment.,Leslie Knope
Which makes more sense.,Leslie Knope
Whatever.,Joe From Sewage
You guys are screwed.,Joe From Sewage
Get used to this.,Joe From Sewage
Because it's going to be hanging on the wall right outside your door for the next 100 years.,Joe From Sewage
That was pretty good.,Leslie Knope
You think they're going to win?,Leslie Knope
No.,Mark Brendanawicz
No.,Mark Brendanawicz
They went super patriotic.,Mark Brendanawicz
It's a classic mistake.,Mark Brendanawicz
"It seems crowd pleasing, but it's still a stance.",Mark Brendanawicz
"And in government, there's always someone who will oppose a stance.",Mark Brendanawicz
Us?,Mark Brendanawicz
Old man feeding pigeons?,Mark Brendanawicz
No stance.,Mark Brendanawicz
Absolutely no point of view whatsoever.,Mark Brendanawicz
No point of view.,Leslie Knope
Smart.,Leslie Knope
No.,Ron Swanson
I haven't been back.,Ron Swanson
I wish him good luck in his business.,Ron Swanson
"And yes, I will absolutely go back to get my shoes shined soon.",Ron Swanson
"I don't, frankly, see why this is a topic for discussion.",Ron Swanson
"Oh, hey, Ron.",Andy Dwyer
What's up?,Andy Dwyer
"Uh Andy, you know, the thing the other day?",Ron Swanson
"Other day, other day... Yeah.",Andy Dwyer
"Oh, yesterday?",Andy Dwyer
I am... That... That... Was... I feel--,Ron Swanson
"I'm okay-- You know, I'd be okay if we... I'd be okay if we never mentioned it again.",Andy Dwyer
Never mention what again?,Ron Swanson
"The moan, Ron.",Andy Dwyer
The weird moan you made.,Andy Dwyer
That was super weird.,Andy Dwyer
Do you not remember that? I talked about it with the lady who went after you for a half an hour.,Andy Dwyer
She said she thought it was an animal--,Andy Dwyer
Okay.,Ron Swanson
It was just an odd moment.,Ron Swanson
"Let's just, let's just not talk about it anymore.",Ron Swanson
That's what I was trying to say.,Andy Dwyer
"But, yeah.",Andy Dwyer
Okay.,Andy Dwyer
Okay.,Ron Swanson
Good time.,Andy Dwyer
Ms. Knope.,Chief Konner
Chief Konner.,Leslie Knope
What do you got there?,Leslie Knope
"Well, we aren't really artists.",Chief Konner

We gotta talk ourselves out of this late registration fee for the Parks van.,Ron Swanson

That is the creepiest place on Earth.,Leslie Knope
The fourth floor is awful.,Leslie Knope
"The DMV, divorce filings, probation offices.",Leslie Knope

I think Tom seems fine.,Ron Swanson

That'll make her feel better.,Ron Swanson
She'll get off your jock.,Ron Swanson

Really?,Ann Perkins
That worked?,Ann Perkins

I'll start.,Jerry Gergich
I really wish I could have your body.,Jerry Gergich
What?,Tom Haverford
Ew!,April Ludgate
"Like, tied up, naked, in your basement?",April Ludgate

"Thank you, Donna.",Tom Haverford
"Hey, garcon.",Tom Haverford
I'm still feeling pretty sad.,Tom Haverford
Can I get two creme brulees and another glass of bronto grigio?,Tom Haverford
"I thought I had Tom all figured out, but it's almost like he's faking being sad.",Leslie Knope
Why would he do that?,Leslie Knope
And that's game.,Mark Brendanawicz
I think you now owe me 25 dollars.,Mark Brendanawicz
Shoot.,Andy Dwyer

I like pretending to be sad.,Tom Haverford
I now see why girls do it.,Tom Haverford
"So, your arrangement with Wendy, it really was completely platonic?",Ron Swanson
Yeah.,Tom Haverford
"Never so much as even kissed, except for a little peck at the wedding ceremony for appearances.",Tom Haverford
"Uh, now that you're getting divorced, I sort of feel like there may be some potential with me and Wendy.",Ron Swanson
"Would it be okay with you if I was to ask her out, once the fake dust settles?",Ron Swanson
"Yeah, why not?",Tom Haverford
Sure.,Tom Haverford
"Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size for me.",Ron Swanson
I'm gonna take a leak.,Ron Swanson
Oh!,Mark Brendanawicz
"That would be 6,400 dollars.",Mark Brendanawicz
I accept checks and most major credit cards.,Mark Brendanawicz

What are you talking about?,Andy Dwyer
"No more comments, no more showing up when we're hanging out together.",Mark Brendanawicz
You have to leave us alone.,Mark Brendanawicz

"Tom, I'm sorry.",Leslie Knope
"Maybe you guys just need some time apart, you know, to remember how much you care about each other.",Leslie Knope
"Leslie, think about it.",Tom Haverford
Does our marriage really make sense to you?,Tom Haverford
"She's a tall, beautiful surgeon.",Tom Haverford
"I'm a short, beautiful government employee slash club promoter.",Tom Haverford
You're a club promoter?,Leslie Knope
Aspiring.,Tom Haverford

It wasn't even a real marriage.,Tom Haverford
"Now, the sadness is pouring out of Tom, like blood from a pterodactyl after it's attacked by a T-Rex.",Leslie Knope
I have to take him to a place where he can't possibly be sad.,Leslie Knope

We are going to the Glitter Factory.,Leslie Knope
What?,Tom Haverford

"I'm a feminist, okay?",Leslie Knope
"I would never, ever go to a strip club.",Leslie Knope
"I've gone on record that if I had to have a stripper's name, it would be ""Equality.""",Leslie Knope

So don't blow this.,Leslie Knope
All right.,Tom Haverford
Okay!,Leslie Knope
Lap dances are on me.,Leslie Knope
"I mean, I'm paying for them.",Leslie Knope
They're not gonna actually be on me.,Leslie Knope
Got it.,Tom Haverford

'Cause there are some feminist scholars who say that stripping is a feminist act.,Leslie Knope
There is a girl here that also works at Quiznos.,Tom Haverford
"She's really nice to me here, but really mean to me at Quiznos.",Tom Haverford
"Okay, Tom, go put these in places I do not approve of.",Leslie Knope

"Leslie, I don't want to do that.",Tom Haverford
"Well, I already paid her.",Leslie Knope
Can I get my money back?,Leslie Knope
No.,Sierra
"Okay, so let her do her writhing.",Leslie Knope
All right.,Tom Haverford
"I just gotta say, Sierra.",Leslie Knope
"I really don't get why this cheers men up, because it's very insincere and it's very fleeting.",Leslie Knope
"But go crazy, okay?",Leslie Knope
Give my friend here the works.,Leslie Knope
Really grind the sorrow out of him.,Leslie Knope
You got it.,Sierra

Whoo!,Leslie Knope
Stripper dancing action!,Leslie Knope
This isn't working.,Tom Haverford
I don't want to do this.,Tom Haverford

It's exactly how I felt when that Planet Earth series ended.,Leslie Knope
Sixty days.,Tom Haverford
And then she's free to marry Ron Swanson.,Tom Haverford
What? Ron?,Leslie Knope
He's gonna ask her out.,Tom Haverford
He told me.,Tom Haverford

"If it's not him, it'll just be some other guy.",Tom Haverford
Swanson! Did you tell Tom that you were gonna ask out Wendy?,Leslie Knope
It's complicated.,Ron Swanson
"What is wrong with you? I wish I wasn't alive to hear myself say this, but I am ashamed to be your deputy.",Leslie Knope
I don't get men.,Leslie Knope
"If they're not wagering their girlfriends in pool, then they're trying to steal each other's wives.",Leslie Knope
It makes you question the whole notion of those bromance movies.,Leslie Knope
Tom.,Leslie Knope
Great!,Leslie Knope
"Good, okay.",Leslie Knope
"Could you carry him out of here, please? And, you know, also maybe not have sex with his wife?",Leslie Knope

How's it going?,Ron Swanson
Good.,Extra
"You know what, Wendy? You and Ron will be perfect for each other.",Leslie Knope

"I see your resume here. Education, exellent. Awesome professional experience.",Tom Haverford
But I don't care.,Tom Haverford
I'm interested in real world expertise.,Tom Haverford
I got a nightclub opening to go to.,Tom Haverford

That was a trick question.,Tom Haverford
The answer's this one.,Tom Haverford
I didn't even know that one existed.,Brian

But those hopes have been dashed. You can leave.,Tom Haverford
"You ever see that movie, The Matrix?",Chris
Yeah.,Leslie Knope
99% real.,Chris
"So, do you enjoy it, being an MRI technician?",Leslie Knope
Great question.,Chris
Someone steps into the room.,Chris
"Imagine a mother of three, maybe she's a teacher.",Chris
"She knows something's wrong, but she doesn't know what it is.",Chris
She's scared.,Chris
"In less than an hour, I know what it is.",Chris
What's wrong with her?,Leslie Knope
I don't know.,Chris
"But the best part about being an MRI technician is, I can see inside everything.",Chris
See that guy over there?,Chris
Imagine being able to look inside his head.,Chris
Wow.,Leslie Knope
I know.,Chris
"You could look inside this steak or you could look inside this butter or these potatoes, or this candle, or this beer, or this flower, or this bread.",Chris
You can look inside anything.,Chris
"Well, if you look inside this bread, all you're gonna find is more bread.",Leslie Knope
I don't know.,Chris
I'd have to do an MRI.,Chris
Look.,Leslie Knope
Thisâ¦ it's just bread in there.,Leslie Knope
"Yeah, but what's inside that bread? Could be cheese.",Chris
"Anyway, it's good that you found your calling.",Leslie Knope
"I mean, I've never even had an MRI before.",Leslie Knope
What?,Chris
I don't know about this.,Leslie Knope
"Well, I'm offering you a free scan.",Chris
"It usually costs up to 2,000 dollars.",Chris
I'm kind of spoiling you here.,Chris
"Well, I am a little curious.",Leslie Knope
Good.,Chris
"Frankly, I don't want to invest in someone who only has three months to live.",Chris
Oh.,Leslie Knope
"I'm just trying to think of this as an adventure, you know?",Leslie Knope
Maybe someday we'll tell our grandkids how weird our first date was and how creepy their grandfather was.,Leslie Knope
Try not to smile too much. It'll affect the diagnosis.,Chris
Well hopefully there'll be nothing to diagnose.,Leslie Knope
"Sometimes smiling is read as ""AIDS.""",Chris
"Oh, you're not on your period, are you?",Chris
No.,Leslie Knope
Does that matter?,Leslie Knope
"Well, not for this.",Chris

"All right, Leslie. You're going to start hearing some loud noises and see some flashing lights.",Chris
Okay.,Leslie Knope
So you never told me where you're from.,Chris
I'm from Pawnee.,Leslie Knope
"Keep still, please.",Chris
"And you said that your mom works in government, too, is that right?",Chris

Did you ever break your arm?,Chris
You can answer that.,Chris
"Here, I'll turn it off.",Chris
"One time I was on my bike and some boys were making fun of me, so I chased them and I lost control.",Leslie Knope
I'm surprised you can see that.,Leslie Knope
"It was, like, three years ago.",Leslie Knope
I can't believe I turned the machine off for that.,Chris
"You never had any kids, right, Leslie?",Chris
No.,Leslie Knope
You've got a great oven.,Chris
"Okay, time to go.",Leslie Knope
You got ample room in there.,Chris
"Honestly, if you wanted to, you could go triplets right off the bat, Leslie.",Chris
"You got a big, industrial-sized oven.",Chris
"So we're done, right?",Leslie Knope
Sorry.,Ann Perkins
Hey!,Ann Perkins
How's the date going?,Ann Perkins
Good!,Leslie Knope
We just finished the MRI.,Leslie Knope
What?,Ann Perkins
"Look, I know I said that I wanted to get back out there, but this guy is nuts.",Leslie Knope
"I don't mean to offend you, you know? I know he's your friend.",Leslie Knope
"No, I'm not offended at all. I don't know him that well.",Ann Perkins
Why would you think he'd be perfect for me then?,Leslie Knope
"Well, he seemed great.",Ann Perkins
"Sorry, Les.",Ann Perkins
"I'll find you somebody else, okay?",Ann Perkins
Just don't let this sour you on dating.,Ann Perkins
"Like, what you're doing is really healthy, so keep the faith, okay?",Ann Perkins
"Yeah, okay.",Leslie Knope
Hey!,Chris
No cell phones!,Chris
Don't touch that.,Chris

I set Leslie up on a date.,Ann Perkins
I don't think it's going that well.,Ann Perkins
"Oh, no.",Mark Brendanawicz
With Justin?,Mark Brendanawicz
"Oh, no.",Ann Perkins
This guy I know from the hospital.,Ann Perkins
Why wouldn't you set her up with Justin?,Mark Brendanawicz
I don't really see them together.,Ann Perkins
You know?,Ann Perkins
"Plus, Leslie just got out of a relationship, so I didn't want Justin to be, like, her rebound guy or anything, you know?",Ann Perkins
"Yeah, that makes sense.",Mark Brendanawicz
Leslie is a notoriously cruel and thoughtless person.,Mark Brendanawicz
Why are we talking about this?,Ann Perkins
We're not.,Mark Brendanawicz
What do you see?,Leslie Knope
Well it actually all looks pretty good.,Chris
You've got a large brain.,Chris
Thank you.,Leslie Knope
Yeah.,Chris
"Well, it looks pretty... Hang on.",Chris
That's weird.,Chris
What?,Leslie Knope
What's weird?,Leslie Knope
Your brain.,Chris
See that shadow right there?,Chris
"Oh, my God!",Chris
What?,Leslie Knope
Is that bad?,Leslie Knope
I don't know.,Chris
I'd have a doctor look at that immediately if I were you.,Chris
Are you serious?,Leslie Knope
"Oh, wait.",Chris
Oh.,Chris
"It's, like, a smudge or something.",Chris
We almost wheeled you out of here on a chair.,Chris
Should we go?,Leslie Knope
"Yeah, we should go.",Chris
Can you imagine if you had to spend the rest of your life sipping a steak through a straw?,Chris
That almost happened to you. You were a smudge away.,Chris
Thank God I was here.,Chris
Looks like we make a pretty good team.,Chris
"I'm sorry, but there's just something weird about the way you talk about him.",Mark Brendanawicz
I don't know.,Ann Perkins
There was definitely times when we thought maybe we would go out someday.,Ann Perkins
That's why you didn't set Leslie up.,Mark Brendanawicz
Because you're saving him.,Mark Brendanawicz
"No, I'm not.",Ann Perkins
"Oh, yeah, you are.",Mark Brendanawicz
"Okay, fine.",Ann Perkins
"You don't have someone in your life that you think, ""I don't know, maybe if things were different, maybe, some day...""",Ann Perkins
"If I'm late for dinner one night, you're gonna dump me for Dustin?",Mark Brendanawicz
"No, no. Justin.",Ann Perkins
Justin?,Mark Brendanawicz
"Absolutely not, but if we break up or you die tragically in a city planning accident and I wait a respectful amount of time, I don't know. Maybeâ¦",Ann Perkins
You know what?,Mark Brendanawicz
You can't save somebody for the future while you're in a relationship.,Mark Brendanawicz
Even I know that.,Mark Brendanawicz
"So, did you want to go back to your place?",Chris
"Yeah, actually, Chris, it was nice to meet you, but I think this is gonna be our last date.",Leslie Knope
I get it.,Chris
"Get your MRI and get out, huh?",Chris
This was your idea.,Leslie Knope
Clever lady.,Chris
I guess I'm not as good a tech as I thought I was.,Chris
I should have noticed that you're missing a heart.,Chris
Ew.,Leslie Knope
"Goodbye, Leslie.",Chris
Right.,Leslie Knope
I drove us here.,Leslie Knope

"Hey, do you mind if we pick up my son Nate at his basketball game on the way back?",Chris
"So, how was the big date?",Tom Haverford
"Well, the good news is I don't have cancer.",Leslie Knope
The bad news is I got an MRI bill for 2000 dollars.,Leslie Knope
That sounds hot.,Tom Haverford
I just don't understand why the hell Ann thought we'd be a good fit.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, you slept together?",Tom Haverford
"What? Not sexually. God, what's wrong with you, Tom?",Leslie Knope
This a bad time?,Justin

Seems like the shot is on the other foot.,Andy Dwyer
And the guuy who polishes shoes is now me.,Andy Dwyer
What up? What can I do for ya?,Andy Dwyer
"When you were dating Ann, did you know this guy Justin?",Mark Brendanawicz
"Oh, Justin?",Andy Dwyer
I hate Justin.,Andy Dwyer
Ann was so obviously into him.,Andy Dwyer
It was so annoying.,Andy Dwyer
Right.,Mark Brendanawicz
"I would say, in terms of guys that she's in love with, Justin's up here, I'm up here, and then you're down here.",Andy Dwyer
"Well, I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't crazy, so, naturally, I came to you for reassurance.",Mark Brendanawicz
Do me a favor.,Mark Brendanawicz
Don't tell Ann that we talked about this.,Mark Brendanawicz
Will do.,Andy Dwyer
Ann Perkins! You should be ashamed of yourself.,Andy Dwyer
What you're doing to Mark is not cool.,Andy Dwyer
Why are you guys talking to each other? You know what? Forget it.,Ann Perkins
I'm not getting into this with you.,Ann Perkins
You did something wrong?,April Ludgate
No! I didn't do anything wrong.,Ann Perkins
Yeah.,Andy Dwyer
Come here.,Ann Perkins
This is none of your business.,Ann Perkins
You don't know what you're talking about.,Ann Perkins
"Actually, I do know what I'm talking about.",Andy Dwyer
"Every time I used to sit around all afternoon playing video games wearing only my slippers, all of a sudden, I would start to feel bad about myself, and do you know why?",Andy Dwyer
Didn't you just explain why?,Ann Perkins
I would feel bad about myself because I would start to think about this perfect guy.,Andy Dwyer
"Anytime you would talk about Justin, I didn't feel very important.",Andy Dwyer
That was rough.,Andy Dwyer
"Well, I didn't know that.",Ann Perkins
"Maybe if you had, I wouldn't have left.",Andy Dwyer
"But you do know now, so you have to choose.",Andy Dwyer
It's either me or Justin.,Andy Dwyer
I'm not gonna choose.,Ann Perkins
Wait.,Ann Perkins
I'm dating Mark!,Ann Perkins

Just that I am looking forward to the truth coming out.,Leslie Knope
I would like to say that Leslie is incapable of using people for her own gain.,Tom Haverford

Rufus.,Leslie Knope
We all know Rufus.,Leslie Knope
Everybody loves Rufus.,Leslie Knope
He's a great dog.,Leslie Knope

"Well, they were out on the sixth hole when suddenly, out of nowhere--",Evelyn Rowshlind
Rufus was bitten by a possum?,Leslie Knope
Yes.,Evelyn Rowshlind
How did you know that?,Evelyn Rowshlind
It was Fairway Frank.,Leslie Knope
Fairway Frank is this awful possum who lives near the sixth hole of the public golf course.,Leslie Knope
"And he's actually number three on the Parks Department's Most Wanted Pest List, right behind the bats, who like to poop on the bell tower, and Poopy, the raccoon who poops all over the high school cafeteria.",Leslie Knope
Shouldn't you take this up with Animal Control?,Ron Swanson
Let's be honest.,Evelyn Rowshlind
Animal Control is not the most effective branch of our government.,Evelyn Rowshlind
They're a bunch of burned out morons.,Leslie Knope
"Well, you have the reputation as a person who gets things done, so we'd like you to form a little task force, find the animal and put it down.",Evelyn Rowshlind
A task force?,Leslie Knope
"Needless to say, the mayor will be very grateful for your help.",Evelyn Rowshlind
"Ma'am, the next time we speak, we shall be dancing on the grave of a possum.",Leslie Knope
Great.,Evelyn Rowshlind

"Need my buddy, Mark the city planner, to sign off on the plans.",Ron Swanson
"Sure, I just need to schedule an inspection.",Mark Brendanawicz
That's not really necessary.,Ron Swanson

But you'll be fine as long as you don't have any code violations.,Mark Brendanawicz
"You don't have any code violations, do you?",Mark Brendanawicz
Nope.,Ron Swanson

"Boy, we have a really important job for you.",Leslie Knope
We'll get to it first thing Monday.,Eugene

Nope.,Eugene
"Hey, Brett.",Tom Haverford
Yeah?,Brett
Dude.,Harris
"Listen, that stupid possum is on the golf course again.",Leslie Knope
"Would you rather I capture it myself, and then just call you, so you can come and pick it up?",Leslie Knope
Okay.,Eugene
"Hey, guys.",Leslie Knope
Cool!,Leslie Knope
"Hey, you want your ball back?",Leslie Knope
Want your ball back?,Leslie Knope
Come with me.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, man!",Harris
"How you know my name, homie?",Brett
"Stop, man!",Harris
Stop hanging yourself.,Brett
I'm gonna hang yourself.,Harris
Stop hanging yourself.,Brett
"It's quite a crack team you've assembled, Leslie.",Tom Haverford
"Yeah, well, there's five of us and only one possum.",Leslie Knope
How hard can it be?,Leslie Knope
Excuse us!,Leslie Knope
Task force coming through!,Leslie Knope
Task force clear.,Leslie Knope

I used to love Tiger Woods because he was a great champion.,Tom Haverford

There's no drainage.,Mark Brendanawicz
Doesn't seem to be any ventilation.,Mark Brendanawicz
You've got hazardous chemicals over here.,Mark Brendanawicz
"Yeah, which only I'm breathing.",Ron Swanson
It's the same liberty that gives me the right to fart in my own car.,Ron Swanson
Are you gonna tell a man that he can't fart in his own car?,Ron Swanson
There is a basket of oil soaked rags above a wood burning stove.,Mark Brendanawicz
"Good thing I've got a fire extinguisher, which, I can assure you, is totally up to your precious code.",Ron Swanson
This says it should be recharged June of 1996.,Mark Brendanawicz
Those dates are arbitrary.,Ron Swanson
They're like those expiration dates that the government forces companies to put on yogurt and medicine.,Ron Swanson
Observe.,Ron Swanson
Watch yourself.,Ron Swanson
Yeah.,Mark Brendanawicz
Okay.,Ron Swanson
I'll replace this.,Ron Swanson
Happy?,Ron Swanson
"How long do you think it would take me to learn golf, Leslie?",Tom Haverford
I could teach you.,Leslie Knope
I have a 16 handicap.,Leslie Knope
"But, you know, it takes a lot of practice.",Leslie Knope
"You have to get up early, hit the range, practice reading greens.",Leslie Knope
"Yeah, I don't want to do all that.",Tom Haverford
I think I just want some of those dope pants.,Tom Haverford
"Oh, my God!",Leslie Knope

"You're next, Poopy.",Leslie Knope
"Very impressive, Leslie.",Evelyn Rowshlind
"Oh, thank you.",Leslie Knope
I had a great task force.,Leslie Knope

Great!,Leslie Knope
"And next time you need a special favor from the mayor's office, give me a call.",Evelyn Rowshlind
"Oh, my God, I will!",Leslie Knope
I need so many special favors.,Leslie Knope
Which one should I choose?,Leslie Knope
"Well, you don't have to choose right--",Evelyn Rowshlind
How about an extra recycling can?,Leslie Knope
No.,Leslie Knope
Laminated bus pass?,Leslie Knope

What time do you usually go to sleep?,Leslie Knope
Because my best ideas usually come to me at night.,Leslie Knope
"Let's stick to business hours, shall we?",Evelyn Rowshlind
"Yeah, all right.",Leslie Knope
"See you in hell, buddy.",Evelyn Rowshlind
Am I sure the possum we caught is Fairway Frank?,Leslie Knope
Yes.,Leslie Knope
Am I quite sure?,Leslie Knope
No.,Leslie Knope
Am I sure enough?,Leslie Knope
Maybe.,Leslie Knope
"If it wasn't Fairway Frank, would I feel badly?",Leslie Knope
Of course.,Leslie Knope
Could I live with myself?,Leslie Knope
That depends.,Leslie Knope
"As a city official, it's important that I ask myself a lot of questions.",Leslie Knope

"Hi, Leslie.",Shauna Malwae-Tweep
Hi!,Leslie Knope
Andy.,Leslie Knope
"You remember Shauna Malwee-Tweep, from the Pawnee Journal?",Leslie Knope
How could I forget?,Andy Dwyer
You wrote the article when I fell in the pit.,Andy Dwyer
"And then afterwards, had sex with Mark and everyone talked about it.",Andy Dwyer
"So, you're on the golf course, and you see Fairway Frank.",Shauna Malwae-Tweep
"Well, we see a possum that we believe to be Fairway Frank.",Leslie Knope
"So, for right now, let's just refer to it as a possum.",Leslie Knope
"Let me explain something to you, Tweep.",Andy Dwyer
"When you're in a situation, you don't have time to think.",Andy Dwyer
"So, I thought to myself, ""Don't think, Andy, act.""",Andy Dwyer
"So, you weren't thinking?",Tom Haverford
Not at all.,Andy Dwyer
I cannot emphasize enough how little I was thinking.,Andy Dwyer
Were you scared?,Shauna Malwae-Tweep

"""Friends"" sounds stupid.",Andy Dwyer
Colleagues.,Andy Dwyer
"They are bad at sharing, but they are good at tag.",Andy Dwyer
"Well, your family must be very proud.",Shauna Malwae-Tweep
What does your girlfriend think?,Shauna Malwae-Tweep
The nurse.,Shauna Malwae-Tweep
I broke up with Ann.,Andy Dwyer

Shortly after she kicked me out and told me we wouldn't be together anymore.,Andy Dwyer
"Well, maybe this article will change her mind.",Shauna Malwae-Tweep
What now?,Andy Dwyer
I hadn't even thought of that.,Andy Dwyer
Wow.,Andy Dwyer

Ooh.,Tom Haverford
Silly me.,Tom Haverford
There was this little pom-pom on my glove and it fell off.,Tom Haverford
Have you seen it?,Tom Haverford

"Oh, we're making really good progress on the park.",Leslie Knope
"In fact, there may be some big news on that front coming soon, all because of this very important business card.",Leslie Knope
"So, this isn't a really big story, right?",Leslie Knope
Nobody cares about this very much.,Leslie Knope
"Well, Fairway Frank did bite the mayor's dog.",Shauna Malwae-Tweep
"So, this could be on the front page.",Shauna Malwae-Tweep
"Fairway Frank, You're gonna die, You're gonna fry, oh, yeah, You guilty son of a bitch, You're gonna fry, When they flip that switch.",Andy Dwyer
"Hey, April, can I talk to you about this situation with the possum?",Leslie Knope
No.,April Ludgate
Okay.,Leslie Knope
"Hypothetically, if you were going on a mission to, say, catch a guilty whale.",Leslie Knope
"And while you were catching the whale, you saw something else that may also be another whale, and you were like, ""What?""",Leslie Knope
"But then you thought, maybe it's not a whale.",Leslie Knope
Maybe it's a big fish.,Leslie Knope
Maybe it's a submarine with a face painted on it.,Leslie Knope
"The point is, if I kill the first whale, am I technically a murderer?",Leslie Knope
I don't know what you're talking about.,April Ludgate
I saw a second possum!,Leslie Knope
There was another possum!,Leslie Knope
Wait.,April Ludgate
"Andy's in there talking to a reporter, literally kissing his own biceps and you're telling me he might not be a hero, but just some jerk that goes around tackling random possums?",April Ludgate
No.,April Ludgate
I've gotta help Leslie find the truth.,April Ludgate
"Not because I'm pissed at Andy, which I'm not.",April Ludgate
Because I care so deeply about possums.,April Ludgate
Because they're so adorable.,April Ludgate
April!,Andy Dwyer
Did you see my photo shoot?,Andy Dwyer
I think I nailed it.,Andy Dwyer
"I fell off the stool once when I was trying to look serious, but I'm okay.",Andy Dwyer

I'm really happy for you.,April Ludgate
You are?,Andy Dwyer
"Man, our happy reactions are super different.",Andy Dwyer
"So, he said he's gonna email me the photos in, like, six hours.",Andy Dwyer
Do you want to wait with me?,Andy Dwyer
"Yeah, that sounds good, but I can't because I have to go do something that actually matters.",April Ludgate
Fairway Frank's been haunting the sixth hole for a while now.,Leslie Knope
You must know him pretty well.,Leslie Knope
Sure do.,Joe Campopiano

"Oh, my God.",Leslie Knope
Those idiots are here from Animal Control.,Leslie Knope
They're gonna take it away.,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Leslie Knope
We need a little bit more time to figure out the truth.,Leslie Knope
"Look, I have an idea.",Leslie Knope
I'm gonna distract everybody and then you get that possum out of here.,Leslie Knope
"Can you do that, April?",Leslie Knope
"April, can you do that?",Leslie Knope
Can you get the possum out of here?,Leslie Knope
Can you sneak it out of here?,Leslie Knope
"April, can you do it?",Leslie Knope
Can you do it?,Leslie Knope
"Please, April, tell me you can do it!",Leslie Knope
Yes.,April Ludgate
"Yes, I can do it.",April Ludgate
God.,April Ludgate
"I can't kill the possum, because it might be innocent.",Leslie Knope
"I can't let the possum go, because it might be guilty.",Leslie Knope
"I can't make a good soup, can't do a handstand in a pool, can't spell the word ""lieutenant.""",Leslie Knope
There's a lot of can'ts in my life right now.,Leslie Knope

Don't call me that.,Harris
"Help! Help, my arm looks like it's bleeding!",Leslie Knope

Do you know them?,April Ludgate
What do you mean that Fairway Frank is not here?,Evelyn Rowshlind
"Here's the thing, Evelyn, we're not sure that the possum we caught is, in fact, Fairway Frank.",Leslie Knope
"Leslie, whoever it is, it's a possum.",Evelyn Rowshlind
"And the sooner it's dead, the sooner the mayor can do what he wants with it.",Evelyn Rowshlind
Does he want to have sex with a dead possum?,Leslie Knope
No!,Evelyn Rowshlind
No.,Leslie Knope
He's not a monster.,Evelyn Rowshlind
He wants to stuff it and hang it above the urinal in his office bathroom so that little flecks of pee can get on it forever.,Evelyn Rowshlind
Ew!,Leslie Knope
"Now, Leslie, you did a great job, and the mayor knows that you did a great job.",Evelyn Rowshlind
"Now, where is the possum?",Evelyn Rowshlind
"I'm sorry, but he's somewhere you'll never find it and he's gonna stay there until the truth comes out.",Leslie Knope
"And I will not reveal his location, no matter how much you ask me.",Leslie Knope
"But I'm going to stop talking now because I'm afraid I may accidentally say where it is, so please go.",Leslie Knope
This is interesting.,Leslie Knope
They put down a raccoon that bit a jogger in a park in Staten Island.,Leslie Knope
Wow.,Tom Haverford
"And in Walnut Creek, California, they put down a duck that bit a kid.",Leslie Knope
But security footage later revealed that it was actually a goose.,Leslie Knope
That's great.,Tom Haverford

"April! April, it's Leslie Knope, from the Parks Department.",Leslie Knope
"Stop ringing the doorbell, it's making him mad.",April Ludgate
"Oh, my God! How did this happen?",Leslie Knope
"I let it out of its cage because it needed water, and I thought it would just drink out of the toilet or something, but then it ran off and I couldn't get it back in.",April Ludgate
"He did that, too.",April Ludgate
"Oh, boy.",Leslie Knope
"Yeah, and then I opened all the doors because I thought it would just go outside, but it won't leave the house! It must love tacky pictures of flowers.",April Ludgate
"Okay, okay, okay.",Leslie Knope
I'm gonna fix this.,Leslie Knope
Let me just think for a second.,Leslie Knope

What if it's in here?,Leslie Knope

"I already ruined his big day, and it's my fault that it's in Ann's house, who he's obviously still in love with.",April Ludgate
"I just-- I don't want him to be mad at me, okay?",April Ludgate
Oh.,Leslie Knope
April.,Leslie Knope
He'll forgive you.,Leslie Knope
You think so?,April Ludgate
Yeah.,Leslie Knope
We don't have to call Andy.,Leslie Knope

"Well, I'm proud to say that it's somewhere the mayor can never pee on it.",Leslie Knope
It's okay.,Leslie Knope
Honestly.,Leslie Knope
"I mean, look.",Leslie Knope

Think of the September issue of Vogue.,Leslie Knope
But it's more important to Pawnee.,Leslie Knope
Mainly because we don't get Vogue here.,Leslie Knope
"I'm gonna move this ""Yearning"" ad to the centerfold.",Leslie Knope

Where are we running?,Tom Haverford
"Sometimes, what we want is not always where we are.",Tom Haverford

Is the real winter inside our hearts?,Tom Haverford
We are all struggling for definition in a world that resists our inquiries.,Tom Haverford
"Okay, this isn't gonna work for a number of reasons.",Leslie Knope
"One, this is a summer catalog.",Leslie Knope
"Two, that was complete gibberish.",Leslie Knope
"And three, that child looks like it's abandoned.",Leslie Knope
"So, basically, boo.",Leslie Knope
Next slide.,Tom Haverford
"Oh, God.",Tom Haverford
Weird.,Tom Haverford
How did that... That's a personal photo.,Tom Haverford

Why all the sniping?,Leslie Knope
Not exactly sure.,Ron Swanson
"The only one I know is Michael, and we're not exactly best friends.",Ron Swanson

I'm hungry.,Ron Swanson
"Okay, well, don't be such a baby.",Leslie Knope
I cooked you some bacon for a trail snack.,Leslie Knope

I could smell it in your purse before I even parked my car.,Ron Swanson
And now it's gone.,Ron Swanson

All right.,Tom Haverford
I think we got the boring cliche shot that Leslie wanted.,Tom Haverford

He's doing great!,Tom Haverford
Keep slithering!,Tom Haverford
"I'm not doing anything, soâ¦",Mark Brendanawicz
"Okay, Clarence, um, why don't you describe the first Summer Pawnee Catalog.",Leslie Knope
I remember.,Clarence Carrington
That first year we offered four classes.,Clarence Carrington
I actually taught Homemaking.,Clarence Carrington
Women were not allowed to teach back then.,Clarence Carrington
Really?,Leslie Knope
I thought there were female teachers way before then.,Leslie Knope
Not in my department.,Clarence Carrington
"Well, times have changed.",Leslie Knope
"I'm Deputy Director now, but I'm hoping someday to be the first female director of the department.",Leslie Knope
"Oh, I don't think that's a good idea.",Clarence Carrington
"Women need a lot of blood to flow through to their baby centers, which leaves less to the brain, you see.",Clarence Carrington
Yeah.,Leslie Knope
Mmmhmm.,Leslie Knope
Sure.,Leslie Knope
"I'd stay away from leadership roles, for your own safety.",Clarence Carrington
No!,April Ludgate
No!,April Ludgate
Maybe I should write a song about a picnic.,Andy Dwyer
"Ooh, where'd you come up with that idea?",April Ludgate
The picnic we're having.,Andy Dwyer
"I already have the perfect title, Life is a Picnic.",Andy Dwyer
That's good.,April Ludgate
How about Life is a Picnic with You?,April Ludgate
Whoa!,Andy Dwyer
Then it could be about a girl.,Andy Dwyer
Or Peyton Manning!,Andy Dwyer
Hmm.,Andy Dwyer
You wanna help me write the lyrics?,Andy Dwyer
"Yeah, totally.",April Ludgate
We should grab a drink after this at Tucker's.,Andy Dwyer
"Yeah, I would do that.",April Ludgate
That sounds fun.,April Ludgate
I just have to get my stuff from the office.,April Ludgate
But that's-- That'd be cool.,April Ludgate
"David, what was it exactly that called you to the Parks Department?",Leslie Knope
"Well, I was in Public Works for eight years.",David Moser
But the director was pretty young.,David Moser
Clarence was old and weak.,David Moser
"So, I put in for a transfer, swooped in and pushed him out.",David Moser
There was no other reason you wanted the job?,Leslie Knope
No.,David Moser
Just the money and the pension.,David Moser
The actual job's a nightmare.,David Moser
"I mean, who gives a crap about this crap.",David Moser
"Well, David, I think we've talked enough.",Leslie Knope
"Mark, that's great.",Tom Haverford
"Bobby, great.",Tom Haverford
"Ann, you look miserable!",Tom Haverford
Terrible.,Tom Haverford
Terrible!,Tom Haverford
"Come on, Ann.",Tom Haverford
What are we doing?,Tom Haverford
Maxim or Good Housekeeping?,Tom Haverford
I'm not sure which one is the insult.,Ann Perkins
"Hey, if there's anyone out there that's doing a photo shoot about the dangers of eating undercooked chicken, I can give you Ann's phone number.",Tom Haverford
"Okay, let's stop for a second.",Tom Haverford
"Bobby, I love how you work.",Tom Haverford
Yay!,Bobby
You can have as many juice boxes as you want.,Tom Haverford
"In fact, grab me one, too.",Tom Haverford
Make it an apple.,Tom Haverford
"Mark, great job, you can have a juice box, too.",Tom Haverford
"Ann, take a walk with me.",Tom Haverford
"In a million years, I never thought you would be the problem with this photo shoot.",Tom Haverford
"Didn't you just plan this, like, two hours ago?",Ann Perkins
I just don't get it.,Tom Haverford
How could someone so hot be so bad at looking hot?,Tom Haverford
I'm sorry I'm not a professional model.,Ann Perkins
"And screaming, ""Make your face better!"" doesn't help.",Ann Perkins
"Well, I'm sorry, your face just isn't working.",Tom Haverford
And we need to do something to distract from this boring area.,Tom Haverford
"Now, I didn't want to have to do this, but we may have to go nude.",Tom Haverford
"Goodbye, Tom!",Ann Perkins
Fair enough.,Tom Haverford
I totally understand.,Tom Haverford
But we should get one for safety.,Tom Haverford
"Okay, guys.",Leslie Knope
We're almost there.,Leslie Knope
It's right up here.,Leslie Knope
You really shouldn't be leading us.,Clarence Carrington
"If you're menstruating, you'll attract bears.",Clarence Carrington

But I got them all here and we're gonna have a beautiful picnic.,Leslie Knope
It's gonna-- It's gonna be good.,Leslie Knope
Hey.,David Moser
I just whizzed on a butterfly!,David Moser
"Well, gentlemen, as you know, I'm working on my welcome letter for the Summer Catalog.",Leslie Knope
You should just copy the Eagleton one.,David Moser
I used to just copy the Eagleton one.,David Moser
Did you?,Leslie Knope
I was hoping that maybe you could talk to me a little bit about how the department has changed since you ran it.,Leslie Knope
"Well, I think you've done a wonderful job maintaining the parks.",Michael Tansley
"Thank you, Michael.",Leslie Knope
I appreciate that.,Leslie Knope
Did you enjoy your turn at the helm?,Leslie Knope
"Oh, in a way.",Michael Tansley
"Pencil pushing wasn't really my thing, but I did love the parks themselves.",Michael Tansley
That was the best part of the job.,Michael Tansley
"Oh, isn't it?",Leslie Knope
I totally agree.,Leslie Knope
"Well, thank goodness for you.",Leslie Knope
"Yes, thank goodness for Michael.",Ron Swanson
"Are you still on parole, by the way?",Ron Swanson
"Oh, ha, ha.",Leslie Knope
"Very funny, Ron.",Leslie Knope
Yes.,Michael Tansley
"Yes, Ron, I am.",Michael Tansley
What?,Leslie Knope
He smoked pot.,Ron Swanson
In the office.,Ron Swanson
And in all the parks.,Ron Swanson
Constantly.,Ron Swanson
"In fairness to me, it was a different time.",Michael Tansley
It was the early '90s.,Michael Tansley
"But also, it's ridiculous that marijuana is illegal.",Michael Tansley
Thomas Jefferson grew hemp.,Michael Tansley
"Alcohol is legal, but pot isn't?",Michael Tansley
"That makes sense to you, Ron?",Michael Tansley
"I'm sorry, I can't hear hippies.",Ron Swanson
"So, if you had to sleep with one of the old guys, who would it be?",Andy Dwyer
The super old one.,April Ludgate
Really?,Andy Dwyer
Mmmhmm.,April Ludgate
I'm an eyebrow girl.,April Ludgate
I wanna make out with him and chew his eyebrows off.,April Ludgate
That is really gross.,Andy Dwyer
Anybody got any water?,Clarence Carrington
I want water.,David Moser
"I'm so old, I need to drink water.",David Moser
"Oh, stop it, stop taunting him.",Michael Tansley
"I don't need your help, jailbird.",Clarence Carrington
"If there's any unclaimed meat or cheese, I would like to claim it.",Ron Swanson
Yeah.,Michael Tansley
Like you claimed my job?,Michael Tansley
Yes.,Ron Swanson
"Exactly like that, in that I wanted it, and then I took it.",Ron Swanson
"Okay, guys, you know what I would love?",Leslie Knope
"I would love if anybody just said something positive about, oh, I don't know, anything.",Leslie Knope
I agree.,Michael Tansley
"Let's just relax, smoke another J, and all calm down.",Michael Tansley
Another?,Leslie Knope
"By the way, it's ridiculous that pot is illegal.",Michael Tansley
It grows in the ground!,Michael Tansley
"I've planted marijuana in community gardens all over the city, and it hasn't hurt anyone!",Michael Tansley
What?,Leslie Knope
"You know, Michael?",David Moser
You are one pot loving mother [bleep] pain in the rectum.,David Moser
"Okay, stop it!",Leslie Knope
Stop it!,Leslie Knope
"You're all being awful, horrible men!",Leslie Knope
Uh-oh.,Clarence Carrington
Your little friend come to visit?,Clarence Carrington

Yes!,David Moser
"No! You're next, buddy.",Leslie Knope
Andy! Let's take this picture.,Leslie Knope
"Come on! Get out of your seats, turds.",Leslie Knope
What?,David Moser
Line up over there.,Leslie Knope
Come on.,Leslie Knope
Just please try to look human.,Leslie Knope

Do you have that picture that Andy took? Maybe I'll run it without any text.,Leslie Knope
Yeah.,April Ludgate
I tried to Photoshop it to make it look like they were happy.,April Ludgate
It was really hard.,April Ludgate
Their mouths are so old.,April Ludgate
God! Look at these horrible men.,Leslie Knope
"You know, I don't even know if I want them in my catalog.",Leslie Knope
Would you like these men in your catalog?,April Ludgate
"Oh, my God, April.",Leslie Knope
That's disgusting.,Leslie Knope
What? Look how generous they're being with each other.,April Ludgate
"And here's the ""Obstruction"" series.",Tom Haverford
"What do you think? Amazing, right? I call this one ""The Future.""",Tom Haverford
It's completely blurry.,Ann Perkins
"Yes, it is, Ann.",Tom Haverford

"You mean the ""Unhappy Wife"" photos?",Tom Haverford
"Oh, my God.",Ann Perkins
"These are even worse, somehow.",Ann Perkins
I look miserable.,Ann Perkins

"Now you know what I meant by, ""Make your face better.""",Tom Haverford
"Was there something wrong, Ann?",Mark Brendanawicz

He was being really annoying.,Ann Perkins
Mark looks happy.,Tom Haverford
"Just please don't use these, okay? Let's grab some dinner.",Ann Perkins
Sure.,Mark Brendanawicz
"Hey, Ron.",Leslie Knope
You want me to read you what I have so far in my welcome letter? Nothing.,Leslie Knope
Because you and your jerk predecessors didn't give me anything to work with.,Leslie Knope
Did you print this out? I heard the printer going.,Ron Swanson
Yes.,Leslie Knope
You could've just handed me a blank piece of paper.,Ron Swanson
Oh! Wisdom! Finally.,Leslie Knope
Thank you so much.,Leslie Knope
You can also keep the photo.,Leslie Knope
Thanks for the memories.,Leslie Knope
Good God.,Ron Swanson

That-- That's the wrong one.,Leslie Knope
But the real one's very bad as well.,Leslie Knope
"I want you to know that I'm replacing the ""Welcome Letter"" with this ad for Yearning by Dennis Feinstein.",Leslie Knope
"So goodbye, distilled wisdom of 50 years of experience.",Leslie Knope
"Hello, disgusting fragrance flap.",Leslie Knope
Let me buy you dinner.,Ron Swanson

Sometimes the confidence confuses people.,April Ludgate
"You're good, bro.",Bouncer
You know what? I think I'll just... I'm gonna--,Andy Dwyer
"Hey, I know another bar that always lets me in, if you just wanna go there.",April Ludgate
"Uh... Yeah, actually, I should get going home.",Andy Dwyer
I have a lot of stuff to do.,Andy Dwyer

Screwed the pooch?,Ron Swanson
I don't like that term.,Leslie Knope
It's so vulgar.,Leslie Knope
"Ron! That sucked, today.",Leslie Knope
I'm sorry.,Ron Swanson
There's no other way to say it.,Ron Swanson
They're a bunch of career bureaucrats.,Ron Swanson
What did you think they were gonna say to you?,Ron Swanson
"Leslie, you are the next link in a wonderful chain that stretches back to when our town was founded, and we believe in you and we support you and we'll be following your career.",Leslie Knope
"""You are the chosen one.""",Leslie Knope
Or something.,Leslie Knope
"Well, okay, so, that was the problem.",Ron Swanson
No.,Leslie Knope
You know what the worst part is is I wanna be Parks Director.,Leslie Knope
But every single person who was Parks Director hated their job and hated everyone they worked with.,Leslie Knope
Are we gonna hate each other someday?,Leslie Knope
I don't think so.,Ron Swanson
I think we're gonna be fine.,Ron Swanson
"Anyway, the point's moot, because you're Park Director now and you're not going anywhere and I'm not making you go anywhere.",Leslie Knope
"I'm not gonna stab you in the back or anything, soâ¦ Maybe I should go somewhere.",Leslie Knope
"Maybe I should move, to Eagleton.",Leslie Knope
"Oh, God, the thought of that.",Leslie Knope
"Leslie, you don't have to move to Eagleton.",Ron Swanson
"When I become City Manager, my job is yours.",Ron Swanson
"Of course, my first act as City Manager will be to propose eliminating the Parks Department.",Ron Swanson
Although I expect a spirited debate with Leslie.,Ron Swanson
Who knows what the future holds for me?,Leslie Knope
Maybe I'll leapfrog Ron's job and become City Manager.,Leslie Knope
"Of course, my first act as City Manager would be to double the size of the Parks Department.",Leslie Knope
"Although, I do expect a fight from Ron.",Leslie Knope
But I'll win.,Leslie Knope

Why would anybody ever eat anything besides breakfast food?,Leslie Knope

Ah!,April Ludgate
"Ron, for God's sake.",Leslie Knope
She's an adult now.,Ron Swanson
She should know how to responsibly handle and discharge a weapon.,Ron Swanson
"That there is a Sig Sauer .22 caliber Mosquito, manufactured in Switzerland for their pussy police force.",Ron Swanson

"In the words of the great 19th century outdoorsman Jack London, you can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club.",Leslie Knope
"With those words ringing in our ears, we proudly present our plans for a new park on municipal lot 48.",Leslie Knope
That's good!,Ann Perkins
I know.,Leslie Knope
The yearly budget and planning proposal for a city is called the Master Plan.,Leslie Knope
Isn't that just so awesome you can't stand it?,Leslie Knope
"It's mostly filled with boring, bureaucratic language, so I try to spice it up a little.",Leslie Knope
"So I say the function of man is to live, not to exist. I would rather that my spark should burn out in brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry rot.",Leslie Knope
You wrote that?,Ann Perkins
"Jack London, again.",Leslie Knope
Is there too many Jack London quotes?,Leslie Knope
"No, no.",Ann Perkins

That is easily the most exciting budget proposal I have ever heard.,Ann Perkins

"I mean, it only took us 15 months to do this.",Leslie Knope

Until when?,Leslie Knope
Indefinitely.,Paul
And when will that end?,Leslie Knope
Later than now.,Paul
"So this week, probably?",Leslie Knope
"Look, we are bordering on a full-blown crisis, Leslie.",Paul
The state government is sending a team from Indianapolis to try to solve this budget problem.,Paul
"""In the event the master plan meeting is cut short"", ""in the event I have laryngitis and I present the master plan"", ""in the event the master plan meeting is moved onto a boat.""",Leslie Knope
Look I'm prepared for every sitautionâ¦ except for the one where there's no master plan.,Leslie Knope
Just calm down.,Ron Swanson
You don't even know what they're going to do.,Ron Swanson
"Ron, they're state auditors.",Leslie Knope
They're not gonna come to pat us on the back.,Leslie Knope
They're here to slash and burn.,Leslie Knope
"Well, I'd be fine with that. This government is diseased.",Ron Swanson
"It's like a big, fat, angry slob spending money it doesn't have on crap it doesn't need.",Ron Swanson
"Mmm, mmm, mmm, me want more pointless social programs.",Ron Swanson
"Yummy, yummy, yum.",Ron Swanson
"That's what government does, Ron.",Leslie Knope

They're going to try to eliminate everything we do.,Leslie Knope
We got to fight these guys.,Leslie Knope
They've been sent by the Governor.,Ron Swanson
They outrank everyone.,Ron Swanson
There's no fight to be had here.,Ron Swanson
"Yeah, you're right.",Leslie Knope
I'm not going to fight them.,Leslie Knope
Except that I am.,Leslie Knope
"Okay, Leslie, what do we do when we get this angry?",Ron Swanson
"We count backwards from 1,000 by sevens, and we think of warm brownies.",Leslie Knope
Go do that in your office.,Ron Swanson
Go do it in your office.,Leslie Knope
And we'll wait for these guys to show up.,Ron Swanson
I'll wait for you to show up.,Leslie Knope
You don't need to bring anything but your gorgeous body.,Tom Haverford
"And get this: cover charge is normally 15 dollars. Say my name at the door, it's 13.50.",Tom Haverford
Andy!,Tom Haverford
Hey.,Andy Dwyer
"You coming out tonight, part owner of the club?",Tom Haverford
"Yes, let me ask you a quick question.",Andy Dwyer
"What's the youngest a girl can be that if we go out, I'm not a total scumbag?",Andy Dwyer
You know the old rule.,Tom Haverford
Half your age plus seven.,Tom Haverford
Half my age plus seven.,Andy Dwyer

What if she's slightly younger?,Andy Dwyer
Can I go out with someone younger than that?,Andy Dwyer
"Please, you totally can.",Tom Haverford

Tom says it's okay.,Andy Dwyer
That probably means it isn't okay.,Andy Dwyer
Thank you for meeting with me again.,Mark Brendanawicz
I don't even know really what I want to say.,Mark Brendanawicz
But I guess I just don't get it.,Mark Brendanawicz
"You know, our relationship was so great.",Mark Brendanawicz
"Mark, honestly, it was really nice.",Ann Perkins
"But maybe you thought it was so amazing, because you've never dated someone for so long before.",Ann Perkins
"Well, but for example, we barely ever fought.",Mark Brendanawicz
That's not a good sign.,Ann Perkins
You're supposed to fight sometimes.,Ann Perkins
You're supposed to miss the other person even if they're only gone for 20 minutes.,Ann Perkins
And I just didn't feel that.,Ann Perkins
Did you?,Ann Perkins
"Man, I should have yelled at you way more.",Mark Brendanawicz
"Well, Paul just called.",Ron Swanson
They're on their way.,Ron Swanson

Okay.,Leslie Knope
Ben?,Chris Traeger
I don't think that's a great idea.,Ben Wyatt
Let's do it!,Chris Traeger

"I mean, I made eye contact with him, and it was like staring into the sun.",Leslie Knope
"People, we are here from the state budget office from Indianapolis.",Chris Traeger
Ooh.,Chris Traeger
What does that mean?,Chris Traeger
"Look, simply we are here to tinker with your budget.",Chris Traeger
Think of the government as a broken down carousel.,Chris Traeger

What can you tell me about Jerry Gergich?,Ben Wyatt
He is one of the best people on the planet.,Leslie Knope
He's universally adored here.,Leslie Knope
"If you fired him, there would be a revolt.",Leslie Knope
"Okay, you need to understand that just to keep this town afloat, we probably have to cut the budget of every department by 40 or 50%.",Ben Wyatt
Okay?,Ben Wyatt
"Well, but Chris said that you just had to, you know, tinker with things.",Leslie Knope
"Yeah, he said that because that sounds a lot better than ""We're going to gut it with a machete.""",Ben Wyatt
Okay?,Ben Wyatt
You're a jerk.,Leslie Knope
I'm sorry?,Ben Wyatt
Easy.,Ron Swanson
I'm sorry.,Leslie Knope
"These are real people in a real town, working in a real building, with real feelings.",Leslie Knope
This building has feelings?,Ben Wyatt

"I'd like it to be cold, I'd like it without ice, I'd like it in a glass or a mug with no handle.",Chris Traeger
How can I help you?,Chris Traeger

Okay?,Ben Wyatt
"I mean, Idaho cut their Parks Department by 80%, and Idaho is basically one giant park.",Ben Wyatt

Pawnee is better than Idaho.,Leslie Knope
"No, Pawnee is not special.",Ben Wyatt
Okay?,Ben Wyatt

Freddy Spaghetti.,Leslie Knope
Oh.,Ann Perkins
Children's concerts aren't a priority these days.,Leslie Knope

That's the way it is.,Leslie Knope
"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.",Ann Perkins

I hear that.,Ron Swanson
Don't worry.,Ron Swanson
I have tons more ideas.,Ron Swanson
"Okay, uh--",Ben Wyatt

Mission accomplished.,Leslie Knope
Let's boogie.,Leslie Knope
Mission accomplished?,Chris Traeger

"It was both of our ideas, but it was mostly Ann's.",Leslie Knope
We I had mentioned to Ann that it would be fun if you two went on a date.,Leslie Knope

Wow.,Chris Traeger
I've just had my first bad date.,Chris Traeger
Ann Perkins.,Chris Traeger
Not that sneaky.,Ben Wyatt

Budget solution number 28.,Leslie Knope
Use grazing sheep to mow grass in parks.,Leslie Knope
Note.,Leslie Knope
Tired sheep could become food or sweaters.,Leslie Knope
"Well, I got my answer.",Andy Dwyer
About April.,Andy Dwyer
She hates me.,Andy Dwyer

"And she got a boyfriend, I guess.",Andy Dwyer
From some city in Mexico.,Andy Dwyer
So what do I do?,Andy Dwyer
"Okay. Well, when your back's against the wall and odds are stacked against you, you just... You... You swing the hardest, damn it.",Leslie Knope
You go big or you go home.,Leslie Knope
And you don't seem like the kind of guy who goes home.,Leslie Knope
I'm not.,Andy Dwyer
I don't even really have a home.,Andy Dwyer
"Go get her, Andy.",Leslie Knope
"Okay! Okay, thanks, Leslie.",Andy Dwyer
Okay.,Leslie Knope
"So, we know the people who run this government have no faith in us.",Leslie Knope
My plan is going to change that and bring the budget back.,Leslie Knope
And the answer's been right in front of us the whole time.,Leslie Knope
Check your testicles?,April Ludgate
No. Not that.,Leslie Knope
Although that is very good advice.,Leslie Knope
"Looking at you, Jerry.",Leslie Knope
No.,Leslie Knope
What's going to save us is right there.,Leslie Knope
"Gentlemen, I realize that times are tough and the budget is tight.",Leslie Knope
"But if the people of this town have nothing else to do but sit in their houses and play video games, then Pawnee will die.",Leslie Knope
And we refuse to let that happen.,Leslie Knope
Now.,Leslie Knope
This town was historically known for two things.,Leslie Knope
"Widespread obesity, and the annual Pawnee Harvest Festival.",Leslie Knope
People from all over Indiana would come and gaze in wonderment at how fat our citizens were.,Leslie Knope
"And while they were here, they would also attend the Festival, a full week of corn mazes, hay rides, Ferris wheels, pumpkins the size ofjeeps.",Leslie Knope
"We lost that festival a few years ago, due to another round of budget cuts.",Leslie Knope
And I propose we bring the festival back.,Leslie Knope
"With ticket sales and corporate sponsorship, we'll earn all that money back.",Leslie Knope
"And believe me, people will come.",Leslie Knope
What if they don't?,Ben Wyatt
"Well, then you eliminate the Parks Department.",Leslie Knope
And you guys are all on board with this.,Ben Wyatt
Aye.,Ron Swanson
Yes.,Everyone
"Look, we're not just pencil pushers.",Leslie Knope
We are a reflection of the community.,Leslie Knope
And we believe that we can strengthen that community.,Leslie Knope
"Because in the end, the reason why we're all here is to bring people together.",Leslie Knope
"That, literally, is the most moving thing I've ever heard.",Chris Traeger
And a good idea.,Chris Traeger
"Yeah, all right.",Ben Wyatt
Excellent! Great! Okay.,Leslie Knope
"So, everybody, we're going to party hard for 15 minutes and then, we're going to have our first brainstorming session.",Leslie Knope
"Hello, April.",Andy Dwyer
Do you like the flowers?,Andy Dwyer
What are you doing?,April Ludgate

And I'm coming after her with everything I've got.,Andy Dwyer
"So, do you want to go out with me? No.",Andy Dwyer
I thought you were going to say yes.,Andy Dwyer
But that's okay.,Andy Dwyer
Because I'll be back tomorrow to ask you again.,Andy Dwyer
And again the next day.,Andy Dwyer
And the next day.,Andy Dwyer
Not Friday.,Andy Dwyer
I have to go visit my cousin.,Andy Dwyer

You should do it.,Eduardo
Follow your dream.,Eduardo
"Oh, my God.",Andy Dwyer

Who hates me.,Ann Perkins
I want another nurse.,April Ludgate
"Well, there are none.",Ann Perkins
We're stretched pretty thin right now.,Ann Perkins
"Then, I want a janitor.",April Ludgate
"They can do what you do, right?",April Ludgate
Yep.,Ann Perkins
Nurses and janitors are totally interchangeable.,Ann Perkins
Except no one dresses up like a janitor when they want to be slutty.,April Ludgate
I get the sense that maybe you're angry at me for kissing Andy.,Ann Perkins
"No, I'm not.",April Ludgate
What are you talking about?,April Ludgate
That's crazy.,Ann Perkins
And that you think it might be fun to take it out on me.,Ann Perkins
Please don't do that.,Ann Perkins
Do?,April Ludgate
I can't do anything.,April Ludgate
I'm sick.,April Ludgate
My blankets are on the floor.,April Ludgate

"Sorry, I haven't been feeling myself.",Leslie Knope
"Well, I'm organizing this huge Harvest Festival and I need at least 80 local businesses to participate.",Leslie Knope
And normally this is the kind of thing I would love to do.,Leslie Knope
"But, I'm just feeling really tired.",Leslie Knope
I think maybe my allergies are acting up.,Leslie Knope
"I've already vomited, like, five times today.",Leslie Knope
We're having a meeting tonight at the Chamber of Commerce and we're going to go over all the details.,Leslie Knope
And we'd just love if you could come and join us.,Leslie Knope

You look sad.,Kelly Larson
You look like a weird goon who's obsessed with a kid's book.,Tom Haverford

I did every pair that I could.,Andy Dwyer
I didn't know what to do with these.,Andy Dwyer
I think they're gloves.,Andy Dwyer

They are for adventure racing.,Chris Traeger
"They perfectly contour to the human foot, and the human foot is the ultimate technology.",Chris Traeger

"Well, this is an interesting turn of events.",Shauna Malwae-Tweep
Is it?,Leslie Knope
I don't know.,Leslie Knope
"I mean, I guess it's kind of interesting.",Leslie Knope
"What the real story is is how wonderful our time capsule is and how it perfectly encapsulates, a word I really think you should use, what our town is all about.",Leslie Knope
"Hey, how's this for a headline?",Shauna Malwae-Tweep
"""Parks Department Foiled by Pipe Dreams.""",Shauna Malwae-Tweep
"God, that's an amazing headline, but please don't write that story.",Leslie Knope

I'm nice.,Andy Dwyer
Good!,Chris Traeger
Nice.,Chris Traeger

"I couldn't really get into it, though.",Leslie Knope
More of a Harry Potter girl myself.,Leslie Knope
What?,Kelly Larson

"Did a little research, and Liz Waverly is 12 years old, a straight-A student at King Philip Middle.",Leslie Knope
"She's also a member of many Twilight Internet message boards, and I'm guessing your daughter?",Leslie Knope
Is that why you did this?,Leslie Knope
To impress your daughter?,Leslie Knope
"Liz's mom and I divorced a couple years ago, and it's been really hard on her.",Kelly Larson
She loves Twilight.,Kelly Larson
"So, I read about your time capsule and I thought that if I could somehow convince you to get it in there, I'd be a big hero.",Kelly Larson
That's really sweet.,Leslie Knope
You should have told me you were doing this for your daughter.,Leslie Knope
I didn't want to drag her into it.,Kelly Larson
I'm sorry.,Kelly Larson
This is a mistake.,Kelly Larson
You don't have to put Twilight in the time capsule.,Kelly Larson
I think we should put Twilight in the time capsule.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, no.",Ron Swanson
We don't negotiate with weirdoes.,Ron Swanson
"Yeah, what happened to, ""A perfect encapsulation of life in Pawnee""?",Ben Wyatt
"Well, for that guy, life in Pawnee is him and his daughter reading that book.",Leslie Knope
"Besides, I can get Shauna on board.",Leslie Knope
It would make a great human interest story.,Leslie Knope
"Uh, if this gets out, every time you want to do anything, some guy's gonna come into your office and handcuff himself to a pipe.",Ben Wyatt

Ron doesn't even have a front door.,Leslie Knope

"Attack, Yearning, Thickening, Itch, Coma, Sideboob.",Tom Haverford
"Dennis Feinstein, though?",Ben Wyatt
I don't know.,Ben Wyatt
He should probably change his name to something a little more exotic if he wants to make it big in perfume.,Ben Wyatt
"Oh, his real name is Dante Fiero, but he changed it to Dennis Feinstein 'cause that's way more exotic in Pawnee.",Tom Haverford
Okay.,Ben Wyatt
So what's your plan?,Ben Wyatt
"Wait till he's alone, then I'll walk up and spray him with Tommy Fresh, and I say, "" Uh-oh.""",Tom Haverford
"""Looks like you just inhaled your future.""",Tom Haverford
Yeah.,Ben Wyatt

"One time I was dating this guy for a while, and then he got down on one knee and he begged me to never call him again.",Leslie Knope
One guy broke up with me while we were in the shower together.,Leslie Knope
Skywriting isn't always positive.,Leslie Knope
"Another time, a guy invited me to a beautiful picnic with wine and flowers, and then, when I tried to sit down, he said, ""Don't eat anything.""",Leslie Knope
"""Rebecca's coming.""",Leslie Knope

I don't know what the big deal is.,Ben Wyatt
Get out.,Leslie Knope
"Okay, couldn't you put Sue's Salads here?",Tanya
On Deep Fried Boulevard?,Leslie Knope
It's just-- There's so many junk food places and only one salad stand.,Tanya
"Well, we want to make money, not make people hate themselves.",Leslie Knope
Salad's are my life.,Tanya
"Of course, I'm sorry, you know what we'll do, we'll make Sue's Salads the official healthy choice of the festival.",Leslie Knope
"Well that's great, thank you.",Tanya
"Of course, nobody's going to come to your stupid booth anyway.",Leslie Knope
The Harvest Festival is the biggest thing I've ever done in my career.,Leslie Knope

This guy's here.,April Ludgate
"Hey, Ken.",Leslie Knope
"Hi, Leslie.",Ken Hotate
This is Ben and Tom.,Leslie Knope
That's a dope bolo.,Tom Haverford
This is Ken Hotate.,Leslie Knope
He is the tribal leader of the Wamapoke.,Leslie Knope
"I just said, hello honored guest. Although literally translated it means may you be blessed with a million possums.",Leslie Knope
The Wamapoke used to use possums as currency.,Leslie Knope
Have a seat.,Leslie Knope
"Ken, I know why you're here.",Leslie Knope
And just let me say that we really tried.,Leslie Knope
"I'm sorry, Leslie, but this is a big one.",Ken Hotate
I'm under a lot of pressure.,Ken Hotate
I'm going to need to formally ask you to move the carnival.,Ken Hotate
I'm sorry.,Ben Wyatt
What's going on?,Ben Wyatt
"The carnival is on the site of the Battle of Indian Hill, which was an epic seven day battle that the Wamapoke lost due to the fact that they didn't have any weapons.",Leslie Knope
"During the battle, 93 year old chief was shot one hundred and two times by the cavalry.",Ken Hotate
Did he die?,Tom Haverford
Yes.,Leslie Knope
And this moment will be commemorated for the next seven days with shooting galleries and fried dough stands.,Ken Hotate
"Ken, I understand, but this is the only place in town that's big enough to house the carnival rides.",Leslie Knope
"Plus, you know with Pawnee's history, it's very difficult to not be offensive.",Leslie Knope
This is a map of all the atrocities the Pawnee settlers inflicted upon the Wamapoke Indians.,Leslie Knope
The atrocities are in blue.,Leslie Knope
"We put up a memorial plaque, and we have a Wamapoke exhibit in the history tent.",Leslie Knope
"I completely understand you, but this is sacred burial ground.",Ken Hotate
And I just hope that the souls of my ancestors don't put a curse on this festival.,Ken Hotate
There are two things I know about white people.,Ken Hotate
"They love Rachael Ray, and they are terrified of curses.",Ken Hotate
Hey.,Ben Wyatt
Hey.,Leslie Knope
"So, somebody, I don't want to say who, it was totally me, got Sweetums to donate another fifteen cotton candy machines.",Ben Wyatt
"Take that, curse.",Leslie Knope
"Take that, curse.",Ben Wyatt
"Ow, ow, ow!",Leslie Knope
Right in the chest.,Ben Wyatt
Bazooka.,Ben Wyatt
That's funny.,Ben Wyatt
"Ugh, get a room.",Tom Haverford
"Okay, so guys, focus up.",Leslie Knope
"Joan Callamezzo is coming by with a camera crew for an exclusive, last minute walkthrough of the Harvest Festival before we open tomorrow.",Leslie Knope
"So, everything needs to be perfect.",Leslie Knope
Joan is always looking for a scandal.,Leslie Knope
She's like an eagleeyed tiger.,Leslie Knope
Eagle Eyed Tiger.,Andy Dwyer
New band name.,Andy Dwyer
I call it.,Andy Dwyer
"So, everybody, gather around.",Leslie Knope
Let's grab hands.,Leslie Knope
I don't hold hands.,Ron Swanson
Okay.,Leslie Knope
"You're all amazing, wonderful people.",Leslie Knope
"And I really want you to have fun today and not focus on the fact that if one thing goes wrong, we're all going to lose our jobs.",Leslie Knope
That's not inspiring.,Ben Wyatt
Okay.,Leslie Knope
"Let's go get them, everybody.",Leslie Knope
Okay.,Leslie Knope
"Any concerns, address them to Ron.",Leslie Knope
"The advantages to being Leslie's boss is that she does everything herself, and there are never any problems.",Ron Swanson
"Which means for the next week, I can sit in this lawn chair, and read this book about old boats. Excuse me, I have to get back to work.",Ron Swanson
"Hey, whatever happened to you and the Bionic Man?",Donna Meagle
Chris?,Ann Perkins
"He broke up with me, but he did it so nicely that I didn't even realize he did it.",Ann Perkins
I've done that to multiple men.,Donna Meagle
How are you doing?,Donna Meagle
Are you doing okay?,Donna Meagle
Thank you so much for asking.,Ann Perkins
It's been tough.,Ann Perkins

"Two days ago, I was sobbing at a pizza buffet, and they asked me to leave.",Ann Perkins
I've been looking at some dog adoption websites.,Ann Perkins
Bought 700 dollars worth of candles from Anthropologie.,Ann Perkins
I did this to my hair.,Ann Perkins
"You know, your basic bottoming out kind of stuff.",Ann Perkins
Yeah.,Donna Meagle
"Normally, people tell you to talk about your problems.",Donna Meagle
I'm going to recommend you bottle that noise up.,Donna Meagle
That's what my mailman said.,Ann Perkins
Murder.,Joan Callamezzo
Murder the most melons.,Joan Callamezzo
Shaquille showered.,Joan Callamezzo
Shame on Shakira's sheets.,Joan Callamezzo
"Hello, Joan.",Leslie Knope
"Hello, Leslie.",Joan Callamezzo
Looks like a very impressive festival.,Joan Callamezzo
But we'll see.,Joan Callamezzo
We'll see.,Joan Callamezzo
You remember Ben.,Leslie Knope
Hi.,Joan Callamezzo
It's nice to see you again.,Joan Callamezzo
Let's get started.,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Joan Callamezzo
"Now, the festival is spread throughout the town, but the centerpiece is the carnival.",Leslie Knope
And over here is Indiana's largest corn maze.,Leslie Knope
Wow.,Joan Callamezzo
Is that Pawnee corn or Eagleton corn?,Joan Callamezzo
Pawnee corn.,Leslie Knope
And it's organic.,Leslie Knope
"Over here, we have our beautiful Ferris wheel.",Leslie Knope
"Beautiful, but deadly.",Joan Callamezzo
When was the last time this giant wheel of death was inspected?,Joan Callamezzo
"Actually, twice in the last week, and everything is 100% up to code.",Ben Wyatt
How many of these carnies are illegals?,Joan Callamezzo
None.,Leslie Knope
They're all U.S citizens.,Leslie Knope
"Over in this booth, Indiana basketball legend Larry Bird's Aunt Tilda will be signing autographs for two hours on Thursday.",Leslie Knope
You got Tilda?,Joan Callamezzo
Yeah.,Leslie Knope
We got Tilda.,Leslie Knope
But the real coup is over there.,Leslie Knope
Little Sebastian.,Leslie Knope
Are you [bleep] kidding me?,Joan Callamezzo
You got Little Sebastian?,Joan Callamezzo
See for yourself.,Leslie Knope
Wow.,Leslie Knope
He is so adorable.,Leslie Knope
"Thank you, Joan.",Tom Haverford
"And Little Sebastian isn't bad, either!",Tom Haverford
Tom!,Joan Callamezzo
How are you?,Tom Haverford
Good.,Joan Callamezzo
Good to see you.,Tom Haverford
Hold on a second.,Tom Haverford
What?,Joan Callamezzo
Did you get your breasts done?,Tom Haverford
You look amazing.,Tom Haverford
"Yes, thanks for noticing.",Joan Callamezzo
"Joan, listen to me.",Tom Haverford
"This Harvest Festival, it's going to knock your socks off.",Tom Haverford
"And when it does, I'm going to be there to give you a foot massage.",Tom Haverford
To completion.,Tom Haverford
Okay.,Joan Callamezzo
Good lord.,Ben Wyatt
I swear.,Andy Dwyer
It's almost like they don't want you to win.,Andy Dwyer
"Well, you better practice.",Andy Dwyer
You've got to win me a teddy bear.,April Ludgate
I'm going to win you a million teddy bears.,Andy Dwyer
"Well, I want a billion teddy bears.",April Ludgate
"Well, that's a little unrealistic.",Andy Dwyer
This is a hard game.,Andy Dwyer
Two million.,Andy Dwyer
Deal.,April Ludgate
All right.,Andy Dwyer
"Hey, I love you.",April Ludgate
"Dude, shut up!",Andy Dwyer
That is awesome sauce.,Andy Dwyer
You're such a good boy.,Jerry Gergich
"Jerry, stop bothering Little Sebastian.",Tom Haverford
Leslie said I should watch him for a little bit.,Tom Haverford
Perfect.,Jerry Gergich
I've got to go get him a tail scrunchie.,Jerry Gergich
"Hi Little Sebastian, how's it going?",Tom Haverford
"Pretty good, just eating some hay, hanging out. What's your name?",Tom Haverford
My name's Tom. Oh you're really well-dressed.,Tom Haverford
"I like how you have your t-shirt over your dress shirt, you look way cooler than everybody else here.",Tom Haverford
"Little Sebastian come on, you're making me blush.",Tom Haverford
Most people look at Little Sebastian and they see a famous minihorse.,Tom Haverford
"I see an advertising opportunity for my club, the Snakehole Lounge.",Tom Haverford
Wow.,Tom Haverford
That is a shockingly huge minihorse erection.,Tom Haverford
"I don't think I'm being unprofessional, I was really hoping for more tawdry scandals.",Joan Callamezzo
"What about your friend Ben, here?",Joan Callamezzo
We all know his story.,Joan Callamezzo
"One of failure, remind us of that failure.",Joan Callamezzo
"Well, you know, when I was an 18 year old mayor, I tried to build a winter sports complex called Ice Town, and it bankrupted the city.",Ben Wyatt
Yikes.,Joan Callamezzo
I was also shortstop of my J.V baseball team.,Ben Wyatt
No one ever brings that up.,Ben Wyatt
"And now, you're involved with this.",Joan Callamezzo
"Do I smell another disaster, hopefully?",Joan Callamezzo
"Look, Joan, this festival, thanks to the tireless efforts of Leslie Knope, is going to bring people nothing but happiness.",Leslie Knope
Not even I could screw that up.,Leslie Knope
"I'm a reporter, not your therapist.",Joan Callamezzo
"So, anytime someone takes a picture of him, the Snakehole's logo is in it.",Tom Haverford
Am I a genius or what?,Tom Haverford
"Hey, Tom.",Jerry Gergich
Where's Little Sebastian?,Jerry Gergich
"Somebody left the gate open and he got out, Jerry.",Tom Haverford
What?,Jerry Gergich
What are you talking about?,Jerry Gergich
Unbelievable.,Tom Haverford
Another in a long string of miserable failures.,Tom Haverford
You lost Little Sebastian!,Tom Haverford
I wasn't even here!,Jerry Gergich
Exactly.,Tom Haverford
"Hopefully I can get you out this mess, that you and no one else caused.",Tom Haverford
You were the one watching him.,Jerry Gergich
It's a poor workman that blames his tools.,Tom Haverford
You look for him.,Tom Haverford
I'm going to go tell everyone what you did.,Tom Haverford
The Harvest Festival starts at 9:00 a.m tomorrow morning.,Joan Callamezzo
"And as far as this reporter is concerned, it's well worth your time.",Joan Callamezzo
"Come on down, everyone.",Leslie Knope
It's going to be sweet.,Leslie Knope
"It pains me to say this, but great job here.",Joan Callamezzo
Thank you.,Leslie Knope
That went well.,Leslie Knope
Yeah.,Leslie Knope
It did.,Leslie Knope
"Take that, curse.",Leslie Knope
"Take that, curse.",Ben Wyatt
Sorry?,Joan Callamezzo
What is this about a curse?,Joan Callamezzo
Curse?,Joan Callamezzo
What?,Leslie Knope
Nothing.,Leslie Knope
Did you Leslie!,Tom Haverford
Leslie!,Tom Haverford
It's Little Sebastian.,Tom Haverford
He's gone.,Tom Haverford
"Jerry let him escape, and we don't know where he is.",Tom Haverford
Keep those cameras up.,Joan Callamezzo
We've got a new intro to do.,Joan Callamezzo
Gotcha.,Joan Callamezzo
Let's go ahead.,Joan Callamezzo
Let's get some shots of chipped paint and crying babies.,Joan Callamezzo
How about some of those spooky traffic lights?,Joan Callamezzo
"Okay, you know the drill.",Joan Callamezzo
Okay.,Joan Callamezzo
Is it revenge of the Wamapoke?,Joan Callamezzo
An incompetent government run amok?,Joan Callamezzo
Or probably something even worse than any of those things?,Joan Callamezzo
"While it seemed everything was ready for tomorrow, things aren't always exactly as they may seem.",Joan Callamezzo
"This is bad, right?",Ben Wyatt
Yes this is bad.,Leslie Knope
This is like a poop tornado. This is like a poop-nado.,Leslie Knope
"Okay, well, gross, but we can handle a little bad publicity.",Ben Wyatt
This is way worse than that.,Leslie Knope
"This is a huge government project, and it's already a lightning rod.",Leslie Knope
"And then, you add the Wamapoke controversy.",Leslie Knope
Double lightning rod.,Leslie Knope
"Plus, we lost that little pony.",Ben Wyatt
It's a mini-horse.,Leslie Knope
And that's the third lightning rod.,Leslie Knope
Triple lightning rod.,Leslie Knope
"And then, you have the curse.",Leslie Knope
Quadruple lightning rod.,Leslie Knope
It's a classic four-rod distaster.,Leslie Knope
"Oh right, one of those.",Ben Wyatt
"God, now all the vendors are going to bail, and the ticket sales will go down.",Leslie Knope
Wait.,Ben Wyatt
"I'm sorry, but do people in this town really believe in curses?",Ben Wyatt
"Pawnee is an incredibly superstitious town. A travelling magician came through one time and he pulled a rabbit out of a hat, and the mob burned him at the stake for being a witch.",Leslie Knope
The year was 1973.,Leslie Knope
We are really up a creek here.,Jerry Gergich
What the heck are we going to do?,Jerry Gergich
You mean what are you gonna do?,Tom Haverford
"No, what are do gonna you?",Jerry Gergich
What am do gonna I? That's a great question Jerry.,Tom Haverford
Can you believe we left Little Sebastian with the gentleman?,Tom Haverford
"Okay, you were the one watching him.",Jerry Gergich
"Okay apparently I'm gonna get any work done, how did this happen?",Ron Swanson
Maybe Little Sebastian got upset because he tried to share his true feelings with someone and they didn't reciprocate.,April Ludgate
That's not bad.,Andy Dwyer
"Or maybe a balloon popped somewhere and it scared him, sent him running off.",Andy Dwyer
"Tom, Jerry, check the field behind the parking lot.",Ron Swanson
I don't want to go with Jerry.,Tom Haverford
He's the one who deliberated caused me to accidentally let the horse out.,Tom Haverford
Jerry's fault.,Tom Haverford
Jerry's fault.,April Ludgate
Jerry's fault.,Andy Dwyer
Stop it.,Jerry Gergich
Hang on. All of you listen to me.,Ron Swanson
That magnificent little horse is lost and he's probably scared and it's our fault.,Ron Swanson
"Tom, Jerry, you get along.",Ron Swanson
"Andy, April, check the corn maze.",Ron Swanson
Good idea.,Andy Dwyer
Horses love mazes.,Andy Dwyer
Come on.,Andy Dwyer
"Hey, Leslie?",Ann Perkins
"This big, beefy dude just came into the first aid tent because he was dehydrated, and then, a reporter came in and asked if it was because of the curse.",Ann Perkins
No comment.,Leslie Knope
"Did you say, ""No comment""?",Leslie Knope
"You've got to say ""No comment.""",Leslie Knope
I did.,Ann Perkins
"Good, Ann.",Leslie Knope
You're so beautiful.,Leslie Knope
Beautiful Ann.,Leslie Knope
All right.,Leslie Knope
"Well, just treat him and release him, and then, don't say anything to anyone about anything for the rest of the month.",Leslie Knope
Okay.,Ann Perkins
Okay.,Leslie Knope
"Run, Ann, run!",Leslie Knope
Leslie?,Ben Wyatt
You've got to see this.,Ben Wyatt
Yeah.,Ben Wyatt
Thank you for having me.,Ken Hotate
"The fact is, this carnival is being held on top of an ancient Wamapoke burial site.",Ken Hotate
Much like the house in the movie Poltergeist?,Perd Hapley
Exactly.,Ken Hotate
I spoke to Leslie Knope of the Parks Department about moving the carnival and she refused.,Ken Hotate
We do have exclusive animation of that event.,Perd Hapley
Let's take a look.,Perd Hapley
"Oh, I love these things.",Ben Wyatt
Sorry.,Ben Wyatt
Is that what happened?,Perd Hapley
None of that happened.,Leslie Knope
That is exactly what happened.,Ken Hotate
All right.,Leslie Knope
All right.,Leslie Knope
What we do is we move the shooting gallery.,Leslie Knope
That seems to be their biggest problem.,Leslie Knope
Maybe that will make them happy.,Leslie Knope
"Check back in with News Channel 4, number one in curse coverage.",Perd Hapley
You know where I would hide if I was horse. The merry-go-round. Think about it.,Andy Dwyer
You just stand still next to the other horses and no one would ever know.,Andy Dwyer
It's the perfect crime.,Andy Dwyer
"Oh, my God.",April Ludgate
I'm going to go look by myself.,April Ludgate
"Hey, are you alright?",Andy Dwyer
You seem super not happy.,Andy Dwyer
I'm fine.,April Ludgate
"Oh, I forgot to tell you, I might be going to Venezuela tomorrow.",April Ludgate
Forever.,April Ludgate
You're not fine.,Andy Dwyer
"Ludgate, I can read you like the back of a book. something is upsetting you.",Andy Dwyer
Why don't you just go ahead and tell me what it is?,Andy Dwyer
I'm not upset.,April Ludgate
"I'm great, see.",April Ludgate
I'm not mad at Andy.,April Ludgate
Andy's great.,April Ludgate
I awesome sauce Andy.,April Ludgate
April!,Andy Dwyer
This maze is like a maze.,Andy Dwyer
Left.,Ann Perkins
Look right.,Ann Perkins
"Yeah, okay.",Ann Perkins
"I don't know what's sicker, me or your body.",Extra
You aren't sick.,Ann Perkins
Maybe you should check out my abs.,Extra
Are you experiencing abdominal pain?,Ann Perkins
Every day at the gym.,Extra
Eww.,Ann Perkins
Feel.,Extra
Oh.,Ann Perkins
What are you doing tonight?,Extra
I'm prepping the medical tent.,Ann Perkins
I think I'm going to have to pass.,Ann Perkins
Your loss.,Extra
Are you going to hit that?,Donna Meagle
Him?,Ann Perkins
He isn't exactly boyfriend material.,Ann Perkins
Who said anything about a boyfriend?,Donna Meagle
Use him.,Donna Meagle
Abuse him.,Donna Meagle
Lose him.,Donna Meagle
That's the Meagle motto.,Donna Meagle
Grammy Meagle taught me that.,Donna Meagle
"She died at the age of 84, sandwiched between two 30 year olds.",Donna Meagle
"Hey, hey, hey.",Jerry Gergich
Did you find him?,Jerry Gergich
"Yeah, Jerry.",April Ludgate
He's right here in my pocket.,April Ludgate
Damn it.,Ron Swanson
"Okay, he can't have gone that far. He's got the legs of Tom, the endurance of Jerry, and the diseases of Jerry.",Ron Swanson
Ground mission failed.,Ron Swanson
We need a bird's eye view.,Ron Swanson
You want me to climb on top of the Ferris wheel?,Andy Dwyer
"We're extremely confident that there is no curse, and everyone is going to have a great time tomorrow.",Ben Wyatt
Okay?,Ben Wyatt
Wow.,Extra
"First, Ice Town.",Extra
"Now, this.",Extra
"Bad luck really follows you around, huh?",Extra
Okay.,Leslie Knope
I'd like to start by addressing some of the false rumors about the festival.,Leslie Knope
"First of all, we have plenty of food.",Leslie Knope
There is no food shortage.,Leslie Knope
"There are not, as one reporter suggested, dozens of escaped convicts meandering around the carnival.",Leslie Knope
"And at no time was any Parks Department worker, quote, ""feasting on petting zoo animals.""",Leslie Knope
"You were in charge of watching a tiny horse, and you failed.",Tom Haverford
"Look, I'm only going to say this once.",Andy Dwyer
What if Little Sebastian is on this Ferris wheel?,Andy Dwyer
How about you only say that never?,April Ludgate
"Leslie, how big of a disaster will this be on a scale of nine to ten?",Joan Callamezzo
It will not be a disaster.,Leslie Knope
It will be a success.,Leslie Knope
"And I want to let everyone know that, in an attempt to be sensitive to our Wamapoke friends, we have moved the shooting gallery, per their request.",Leslie Knope
"So, yes, Perd.",Leslie Knope
"Yeah, the statement that this reporter has is a question.",Perd Hapley
Will that be enough to lift the curse?,Perd Hapley
"Perd, you know as well as I do that there's no such God.",Leslie Knope

"No, no, no.",Ben Wyatt
"No, no.",Ben Wyatt
Not at all.,Ben Wyatt
I've just honestly never met someone who works as hard as you do.,Ben Wyatt

I'm sorry.,Leslie Knope
"I thought if we all worked really hard, I could come up with something.",Leslie Knope

She is.,Ben Wyatt
Yes.,Andy Dwyer
Because it's hard to tell.,Ben Wyatt

"Welcome to ""Visions of Nature.""",Ron Swanson
This room has several paintings in it.,Ron Swanson
Some are big.,Ron Swanson
Some are small.,Ron Swanson
"People did them, and they are here now.",Ron Swanson
"I believe that after this is over, they'll be hung in government buildings.",Ron Swanson
Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me.,Ron Swanson
I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they can just go outside and stand in it.,Ron Swanson
"Anyway, please do not misinterpret the fact that I am talking right now as genuine interest in art and attempt to discuss it with me further.",Ron Swanson
End of speech.,Ron Swanson

No.,Ben Wyatt
"Yes, it is.",April Ludgate
Are you guys frying marbles?,Ben Wyatt
We were checking to see if the fire alarm worked.,Andy Dwyer
It doesn't.,April Ludgate
The biggest challenge to picking the perfect roommate is finding someone who's willing to pay more than their share of rent without knowing it.,Andy Dwyer
I think we found that in Ben.,April Ludgate
"You forgot to paint a painting, son.",Ron Swanson
"So, for my painting, I chose one of my very favorite Greek myths, the centaur goddess, Dyaphena, slaying a great stag.",Jerry Gergich
It's stunning.,Ann Perkins

I'm sorry.,Jerry Gergich
I'm going to take it right down.,Jerry Gergich
No.,Leslie Knope
Leave it up.,Leslie Knope
I love it.,Leslie Knope
I don't know how to explain it.,Leslie Knope
"Every time I look at it, I just think to myself, ""What can't that centaur woman do?""",Leslie Knope
"""Besides ride an escalator and drive a car.""",Leslie Knope
Art can be so magnificent.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, my God.",Ann Perkins
The baby is Tom.,Ann Perkins
What?,Tom Haverford
This is easily my favorite painting ever.,Ann Perkins
"What the hell, Jerry?",Tom Haverford
Look at my pot belly.,Tom Haverford
I look like a pregnant baby.,Tom Haverford
And why am I so scared?,Tom Haverford
"All right, we've got to take this down.",Tom Haverford
Now.,Tom Haverford

Hmm.,Tom Haverford
"Well, I'm glad someone's feeling good.",Tom Haverford
They're going to hang that painting in a public building where anybody can see it.,Tom Haverford
"In one brush stroke, Jerry has killed the JayZ vibe that's taken me years to cultivate and replaced it with the fat, brown baby vibe, which is not as cool of a vibe.",Tom Haverford
"Hey, Aphrodite.",Donna Meagle
Chris needs you in his office.,Donna Meagle
Hmm.,Leslie Knope
"When you're done with the light, fix the printer.",Leslie Knope
I don't know how to fix printers.,Extra
Learn it.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, should I go, too?",Jerry Gergich
"This isn't about you, Jerry.",Leslie Knope
It's my painting.,Jerry Gergich
Why am I upset?,Marcia Langman
Let's start with government funded animal porn.,Marcia Langman
I'm not sure that's fair.,Leslie Knope
"I want it destroyed, and I want a statement from this office apologizing for an obscene depiction of bestiality.",Marcia Langman
Bestiality?,Leslie Knope
"It is a picture of a centaur, a beautiful half person, half horse.",Leslie Knope
And how did it get like that?,Marcia Langman
Who had sex with what and gave birth to which?,Marcia Langman
"Ms. Langman, we hear you, we understand you and we are going to do whatever we can to come to a solution.",Chris Traeger
Destroy it.,Marcia Langman
Destroy it?,Leslie Knope
"I mean, is she serious?",Leslie Knope
Do you find this personally offensive?,Leslie Knope
"Not personally, no.",Chris Traeger
"No, personally, I enjoy a good artistic depiction of the human form.",Chris Traeger
I've dabbled in nude sculpture.,Chris Traeger
I've posed nude.,Chris Traeger
"In college, I was in a nude production of Cats.",Chris Traeger
"But I am not in the nude now, am I?",Chris Traeger
Because we're in a government building.,Chris Traeger
"And that would be inappropriate, which is what I think Marcia is saying.",Chris Traeger
"So, take care of this situation.",Chris Traeger
That painting is not going to be destroyed.,Leslie Knope
Every great work of art contains a message.,Leslie Knope
"And the message of this painting is, ""Get out of my way unless you want an arrow in your ass, Marcia.""",Leslie Knope
"Morning, roomie.",Andy Dwyer
How did you sleep?,Andy Dwyer
"Well, there were no bedbugs.",Ben Wyatt
"Also, no bed.",Ben Wyatt

"Do you know what ""cute"" means?",Andy Dwyer
What have you got against turkey chili for breakfast?,April Ludgate
What have you guys got against washing dishes?,Ben Wyatt
"We don't have any dishes, okay?",April Ludgate
Burly took them all when he left.,April Ludgate
"Now, I bet you feel like a jerk.",April Ludgate
God.,Ben Wyatt
"Okay, I might need to not stay here anymore.",Ben Wyatt

"Perd, it is a beautiful work of art.",Leslie Knope
"Governments should not be in the business of censorship, especially when a painting is as awesome as this one.",Leslie Knope
But this is where the controversy of this story gets even more controversial.,Perd Hapley
You are the subject of this painting.,Perd Hapley
"Half woman, half horse, with what some would say are human breasts.",Perd Hapley
I am not the subject.,Leslie Knope
The subject is strong and empowered women everywhere.,Leslie Knope
But it does look a little bit like me.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, for our viewers at home who might not know, are centaurs real?",Perd Hapley
No.,Leslie Knope
Absolutely sure?,Perd Hapley

You guys-- You wash your clothes in bubble bath?,Ben Wyatt
"Bubble bath, clothes soap, same thing.",Andy Dwyer
"No, it's not.",Ben Wyatt
"Well, they both make bubbles, so.",Andy Dwyer

Last year.,Brandi Maxxxx
Fantastic.,Perd Hapley
"Now, this painting right here, art or pornography?",Perd Hapley
"Perd, I think this whole debate is ridiculous.",Brandi Maxxxx
What Leslie and I do is obviously art.,Brandi Maxxxx
Hang on.,Leslie Knope
There is a big difference between an oil painting of a Greek myth and a pornographic movie.,Leslie Knope
"It's okay, Leslie.",Brandi Maxxxx
I got this one.,Brandi Maxxxx
What Leslie and I want people to know is you should be able to have sex anywhere you want and show it anywhere you want.,Brandi Maxxxx
"Whether it's girl-on-girl action, bondage, or what have you.",Brandi Maxxxx
Okay.,Leslie Knope
Hang on.,Leslie Knope
Pornography is very difficult to define.,Leslie Knope
"In fact, it was Justice Stewart who once said, ""I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it.""",Leslie Knope
"Brandi, how would you define pornography?",Perd Hapley
"For me, it's when the penis goes in.",Brandi Maxxxx
"All right, we need to do some basic organization.",Ben Wyatt
Where do you put your bills when they come?,Ben Wyatt
I read the magazines and give the rest to Andy.,April Ludgate
Which I organize into a pile or stack that I put into the freezer.,Andy Dwyer
Why?,Ben Wyatt
So they won't get lost.,Andy Dwyer
Bingo.,Andy Dwyer
"Okay, you have to pay these.",Ben Wyatt

"Brandi, I'm Thomas Haverford.",Tom Haverford
I just wanted to say I thought you made some excellent points up there.,Tom Haverford

I urge you not to take that role.,Chris Traeger
I am not going to take the role.,Leslie Knope

I'm sorry that I'm trying to defend a beautiful work of art.,Leslie Knope
"Thank you, Leslie.",Jerry Gergich
"Stand down, Jerry.",Leslie Knope
This isn't your fight.,Leslie Knope
You've left me no choice.,Chris Traeger

"My name is Chris Traeger, and I am a big fan of art.",Chris Traeger
"Council, I am not opposed to pornography.",Tom Haverford
"In fact, you could say I'm definitely for it.",Tom Haverford
"If I had my laptop right now, I would show you a well-hidden folder with gigabytes of proof.",Tom Haverford
"However, this thing is disgusting and wrong.",Tom Haverford
Please let the record reflect that the fat baby is referring to the painting.,Extra
"Hey, I am not a fat baby.",Tom Haverford
"I'm a small, slender man, similar to actor Taye Diggs.",Tom Haverford
So let the record reflect that.,Tom Haverford

Two great societies in Europe.,Leslie Knope

What is or isn't art is up to every free thinking American to decide on their own.,Leslie Knope
"Yeah, it's in the bag.",Leslie Knope
We've decided that the painting should be destroyed.,Leslie Knope
"Yeah, burn it.",Tom Haverford
What are you serious?,Leslie Knope
You're supposed to be in favor of public art.,Leslie Knope
"Yeah but there's nipples in it, so I figure we ought to be safe and destroy it.",Extra
"Okay, here is a list of errands and things that human adults need.",Ben Wyatt
"Also, I'm giving you an advance on next month's rent, and I want you guys to go to Bed, Bath, and Beyond and get everything on that list.",Ben Wyatt
Or we can buy a Wii.,April Ludgate
You can handle this.,Ben Wyatt

"Hey listen to me, yes we're going to get a dish rack and shower curtains and a cutting board, but if you think for one seond I'm not also going to get that marshmallow shooter so I can shoot you in the face with marshmallows while you sleep, then you're the dumbest woman I know.",Andy Dwyer

"I'm glad you finally came to your senses, I'm sure that's not an easy journey for you to make.",Marcia Langman

Nothing.,Ron Swanson
I never Aha!,Ron Swanson
"Oh, God.",Ron Swanson
"Birthday, birthday, birthday It's your birthday It's your birthday, and I know when it is.",Leslie Knope
Ron refuses to tell anyone when his birthday is.,Leslie Knope
He's even had it redacted on all government documents.,Leslie Knope
"Three years of investigations, phone calls, Freedom of Information Act requests, and still, I had nothing, until a well placed bribe to a gentleman at Baskin-Robbins revealed Ron's birthday is on Friday.",Leslie Knope
Damn it.,Ron Swanson
I was so careful.,Ron Swanson
"Well, you blew it.",Leslie Knope
All for a free scoop of Rum Raisin.,Leslie Knope
"Was it worth it, Ron?",Leslie Knope
Was it?,Leslie Knope
I command you to do nothing.,Ron Swanson
I'm not gonna do nothing.,Leslie Knope
I'm gonna do something.,Leslie Knope
And it's gonna be really big.,Leslie Knope
I have a lot of years to make up for.,Leslie Knope
"I don't like loud noises and people making a fuss, and I especially don't like people celebrating because they know a piece of private information about me.",Ron Swanson

Birthdays were invented by Hallmark to sell cards.,Ron Swanson
They put up a fence.,Tom Haverford
Who?,Leslie Knope
No!,Leslie Knope
What's that?,Ben Wyatt
"There's a small park on the line between Pawnee and Eagleton, and--",Leslie Knope
Last night Eagleton put up a fence around their side to keep us disgusting Pawnee hobos off their precious land.,Tom Haverford
There's even a security guard.,Tom Haverford
You got to show Eagleton I.D. to get in.,Tom Haverford
Eagleton is a bunch of rich snobs.,Donna Meagle
And that's coming from someone who has a Mercedes.,Donna Meagle
With a Harman Kardon Logic surround sound system.,Donna Meagle
Who builds a fence to keep kids out of a playground?,Ben Wyatt
"Three words, Lindsay Carlisle Shay.",Leslie Knope
Who?,Andy Dwyer
Lindsay Carlisle Shay and I used to be best friends.,Leslie Knope
We worked together at the Pawnee Parks Department.,Leslie Knope
"Then she went to work in Eagleton and ""fixed her deviated septum"" and lost 35 pounds and lost something else.",Leslie Knope
What was it again?,Leslie Knope
"Oh, yeah.",Leslie Knope
Her soul.,Leslie Knope
Is the Eagleton side really that much better than the Pawnee side?,Ben Wyatt
"To be fair, yeah.",Leslie Knope
Our side is this scrappy piece of land where kids go to smash fluorescent light tubes.,Leslie Knope
But it has a lot of heart.,Leslie Knope
That's what people always say when something sucks.,April Ludgate
"We should stand up for our town, okay?",Leslie Knope
"Pawneeans are just as good as Eagletonians, although on average, we are several inches shorter and 80 pounds heavier.",Leslie Knope
People in Eagleton are straight up mean to us.,Tom Haverford
I would never set foot over there.,Tom Haverford
"But it's the only place that I can get my Bumble and Bumble hair care products, so I'm there every eight days.",Tom Haverford
"Okay, well, I am on ""Operation No More Fence,"" so I'm putting you in charge of ""Operation Ron's Party, colon, Shock And Awe.""",Leslie Knope
I am all over it.,April Ludgate
I just need you to do what's on that list.,Leslie Knope
Leslie has a lot of qualities I find horrifying.,Ron Swanson
But the worst one by far is how thoughtful she can be.,Ron Swanson
It's the only park in our neighborhood.,Extra
"I mean, where are my kids supposed to play, the rock quarry?",Extra
There's rocks in there.,Extra
Why don't we just set fire to the fence?,Extra
"You know, set it ablaze.",Extra
That's arson.,Leslie Knope
"Well, let's leave that up to the lawyers.",Extra
"The point is, it would work.",Extra
Why don't we build a fence around their fence?,Extra
Why?,Extra
"It would give us two fences, so if they needed to get to their fence for maintenance and whatnot, their pants might get caught.",Extra
"My son Joey tried to scale that fence to play on the Eagleton side, and he fell and hurt his arm.",Extra
You need to get those people to tear that fence down.,Extra
This woman's right.,Leslie Knope
"I promise you, citizens of Pawnee, and sweet, brave Joey, I will tear down that fence.",Leslie Knope
"Okay, I'm just gonna suggest one more time that we burn it down.",Extra
But whatever you guys think.,Extra
Yeah.,Leslie Knope
Great.,Leslie Knope

I'm only trying to protect our children.,Lindsay Carlisle Shay
"Come on, Lindsay, this isn't you.",Leslie Knope
"When we used to work here together, we loved the fact that parks were for everyone.",Leslie Knope
That's what makes them so great.,Leslie Knope
You know what's really great?,Lindsay Carlisle Shay
A private park that's not for everyone.,Lindsay Carlisle Shay
Wowsers.,Leslie Knope
What do you care?,Lindsay Carlisle Shay
It's just a crappy little park.,Lindsay Carlisle Shay
"Well, someone once told me that there's no such thing as small parks, just small ideas.",Leslie Knope
Hmm.,Lindsay Carlisle Shay
And that someone was this woman.,Leslie Knope
You can take it if you want.,Leslie Knope
I have many copies and the negatives.,Leslie Knope
And I have a JPEG.,Leslie Knope

"Oh, yeah.",Ben Wyatt

But their people are not inherently better than our people.,Leslie Knope
"The only thing they beat us in is life expectancy, beauty pageants, and average income.",Leslie Knope
Who cares?,Leslie Knope
Factoid alert.,Leslie Knope
Eagleton was founded by former Pawneeans.,Leslie Knope

"Well, we would love to do that, but, unfortunately, money is tight right now.",Leslie Knope
Hello.,Christine Porter
I'm Christine Porter.,Christine Porter

So he wrote a second book.,Ron Swanson
Organize it 2: Engage with Zorp.,Herb Scaifer

"Well, here we are.",Leslie Knope
What do you think?,Leslie Knope
Are you gonna murder me and bury me at this gas station?,Ben Wyatt
"No, this is a great gas station.",Leslie Knope
This gas station was owned by Mick Jagger.,Leslie Knope
Uhhuh.,Ben Wyatt
"I came across some financial records when I was doing some research for my book, and this gas station was owned by an M.",Leslie Knope
"Jagger, which at first I thought was a woman.",Leslie Knope
"Maybe Meg or something, but I think the most likely explanation is that legendary Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger owned this gas station from 1951 to 1958.",Leslie Knope
When he was 8.,Ben Wyatt
"Yeah, and I just knew you were a big fan of financial records, so, you're welcome.",Leslie Knope

Buddhists feel that human beings are unlikely to be reincarnated as human beings.,Chris Traeger

Or a socket wrench.,Chris Traeger
"Ron, if you could be reincarnated, what would you like to be?",Chris Traeger
"Socket wrench sounds pretty good, actually.",Ron Swanson
I think the danger in believing in reincarnation is that you spend so much time trying to figure out what you're going to be in the next lifetime that you forget to enjoy the one you're in now.,Ann Perkins
Ann Perkins that was beautiful.,Chris Traeger
Let's go to that party that Tom's having.,Chris Traeger

"But I have to tell you, Ron If the world was ending tomorrow, I'd want to be with him.",Leslie Knope
"Well, that's significant.",Ron Swanson

The sun's going to rise right over there.,Ron Swanson
"It'll be a regular Friday, and you'll be in the exact same position you were in before.",Ron Swanson
I know.,Leslie Knope
I made my decision. I need to stick to it.,Leslie Knope
It's just the thought of him with someone else is making me miserable.,Leslie Knope
"If it makes you feel any better, Leslie, we'll all be dead in 20 minutes.",Herb Scaifer
That does make me feel better.,Leslie Knope
"Thank you, Herb.",Leslie Knope
Guy's got ears like a fruit bat.,Ron Swanson

"Okay, I have to ask this, I'm sorry, but how many legs did that dog have when you found him?",Ben Wyatt
Three!,Andy Dwyer
That's what makes him the best.,Andy Dwyer

And you remember what you said about making decisions in the house?,Andy Dwyer
You want to be involved.,Andy Dwyer

I'm not gonna send a three legged dog to his death.,Ben Wyatt
Yes!,Andy Dwyer
But I'm not gonna take care of him for you.,Ben Wyatt
"Well, it would be nice if you helped a little.",April Ludgate
"Because, unlike you, Andy and I have jobs.",April Ludgate

What?,Ann Perkins
"I need a team update, campaign manager.",Leslie Knope
Okay.,Ann Perkins
Pistol Pete Disellio will be here in five minutes.,Ann Perkins

"Oh, I can, but I won't.",Pete Disellio
Sorry?,Leslie Knope
"Look, everywhere I go, everybody wants me to talk about that dunk, and that game.",Pete Disellio

"Look, Leslie, I read up on you.",Pete Disellio

Okay.,Ron Swanson

"Glad you asked, Chris.",Ben Wyatt
"You know, there's fast food hamburgers.",Ben Wyatt

What about pizza?,Chris Traeger
Pizza?,Ben Wyatt
Never heard of it.,Ben Wyatt
"That's what people will be saying in 20 years, because pizza is old news, Chris.",Ben Wyatt
Pizza is your grandfather's calzone.,Ben Wyatt
Never thought of it that way.,Chris Traeger
"What I'm talking about is a portable, delicious meal, that is it's own container.",Ben Wyatt
It's a whole new spin on Italian fast casual dining.,Ben Wyatt

And you of all people will like this.,Ben Wyatt
I'm gonna use low fat ingredients.,Ben Wyatt
Gamechanger.,Chris Traeger
"And I will call my new Italian fast casual eatery ""The Lowcal Calzone Zone.""",Ben Wyatt
That idea is literally the greatest idea I've ever heard in my life.,Chris Traeger
That idea is terrible.,Chris Traeger
"Glen, you're killing me.",Leslie Knope
"They broke about 50 laws, Knope.",Police Officer
"And that girl, she tried to get that gimp dog to bite me.",Police Officer
"Look, I could sit here and fill out all the paperwork, but you and I both know that you'd rather go home to Debra, have a nice homecooked meal, and do what comes naturally.",Leslie Knope
That's not appropriate.,Police Officer
You know that I'm gonna pay all the fines.,Leslie Knope
"I'm in the middle of a campaign rally, and this is my team.",Leslie Knope
"I need them, please.",Leslie Knope
Fine.,Police Officer
"But unless one of you has a commercial license, you can't take that truck.",Police Officer
It would just mean so much to us.,Ann Perkins
"I mean, you're a living legend.",Ann Perkins
They still air that game every Friday night on cable access.,Ann Perkins
"Yeah, well, being a living legend is sort of a doubleedged sword.",Pete Disellio
"Everybody in this town still calls me ""Pistol.""",Pete Disellio
"Tell me more about that, Peter.",Ann Perkins
"I mean, yes, that dunk, it made me famous, but sometimes Sometimes life dunks you.",Pete Disellio
"Hey, man, you want to go for a jog?",Chris Traeger
"Just, sort of, kick out the cobwebs, get some endorphins going?",Chris Traeger
"Oh, no, thanks, Chris.",Ben Wyatt
Kind of tearing this Claymation video a new one right now.,Ben Wyatt
"You know, Ben, I really think you need to take a step back here.",Chris Traeger
I think getting some perspective would be good.,Chris Traeger
What are you talking about?,Ben Wyatt

"And, right now, you need help.",Chris Traeger
With my Claymaish?,Ben Wyatt
With your life.,Chris Traeger
"You are wildly, insanely depressed.",Chris Traeger
Depressed?,Ben Wyatt
I'm the furthest thing from depressed.,Ben Wyatt
"I mean, look at what I've accomplished.",Ben Wyatt

Do you think a depressed person could make this?,Ben Wyatt
No.,Ben Wyatt
That's all we can fit in here.,Ron Swanson
No problem.,Leslie Knope
This is going to be fine.,Leslie Knope
"We're all going to be fine, because the team is still together, and there's nothing the team can't do.",Leslie Knope
"Wait, I think Champion has to go to the bathroom.",April Ludgate
Oh!,Andy Dwyer
He shall do it in the car!,Andy Dwyer
"Answer your phone, Ann.",Leslie Knope
That's what life is like in a strict Roman Catholic household.,Pete Disellio
"Of course, my father, he was more stick than carrot when it came to matters of discipline.",Pete Disellio
"I'm sorry, but the Ben Wyatt that I know, I just don't think he'd be happy sitting here faffing around.",Chris Traeger
I'm not faffing around.,Ben Wyatt
I've sunk myself into my hobbies.,Ben Wyatt
"Here, I'll show you my Claymation project, okay?",Ben Wyatt
"Now, I've been working pretty hard on this, and I think it's really good.",Ben Wyatt
"So just hang on to your hat, okay?",Ben Wyatt
Here it goes.,Ben Wyatt
"Oh, how great.",Chris Traeger
Did you pause it?,Chris Traeger

You're gonna be okay.,Chris Traeger
"No, no, no, no, I'm not.",Ben Wyatt
"You see, in my head, I thought that was really, really cool.",Ben Wyatt
"I emailed Leslie two days ago and I compared it to Avatar, Chris, and how can it not be longer?",Ben Wyatt
"Okay, look, what you're feeling, right now is regret and shame.",Chris Traeger
But we are going to get through this.,Chris Traeger
"Okay, no word from Ann.",Leslie Knope
"April, I need a status report.",Leslie Knope
How's it looking out there?,Leslie Knope
"Perfect, but just one thing.",April Ludgate
It's not a basketball court any more.,April Ludgate
It's an ice skating rink.,April Ludgate
"Wait, what?",Leslie Knope
Why?,Leslie Knope
What happened?,Leslie Knope
The stupid guy I called to book this place didn't tell me they took off the basketball floor for a hockey game.,April Ludgate
"Or maybe he did tell me, but he was so stupid and boring that I wasn't listening, and either way, it was his fault, because he was stupid and I hated him.",April Ludgate
"Ron, how's the stage coming?",Leslie Knope
"Well, since we had to jettison the bulk of the wood, this is the biggest I could make it.",Ron Swanson
"Oh, my God.",Leslie Knope
"Good lord, what happened to the rest of my face?",Leslie Knope
"We had to ""Jetsons"" most of the poster too, but I kind of like it, 'cause windows are the eyes to the house.",Andy Dwyer
Wow.,Tom Haverford
"Okay, I got Pistol Pete.",Ann Perkins
"Good, where is he?",Leslie Knope
"Right now, he's curled up in the back seat of my car, talking about his father, who is a piece of work.",Ann Perkins
"I actually think he did the best he could for a single father, but I may be too close to the situation.",Ann Perkins
"Anyway, the important news is that he's here.",Ann Perkins
Good.,Leslie Knope
Is he going to dunk for me?,Leslie Knope
"I'm not sure, I couldn't hear through all the crying.",Ann Perkins
He's crying?,Leslie Knope
"No, I was crying.",Ann Perkins
"It's been a stressful day, and he's had a really rough life.",Ann Perkins
"Oh, my God.",Leslie Knope
"We should cancel it, right?",Leslie Knope

"But for the record, I came through.",Jerry Gergich
There are almost a hundred people out there!,Jerry Gergich
"Oh, damn it, Jerry, you just had to do your job, didn't you?",Leslie Knope
"Yeah, can't you do anything wrong, Jerry?",April Ludgate
"I've been looking at our utter and complete lack of experience as a positive thing, but I'm starting to think it actually might be a problem.",Leslie Knope
"Okay, guys, everybody listen up.",Leslie Knope
I just wanted to say thank you.,Leslie Knope
"You've all volunteered your time and, no matter what, I am eternally grateful for it.",Leslie Knope
"Now, I'm going to go out there, and I'm going to announce the relaunch, and I'm going to muddle through this thing as best I can.",Leslie Knope

"I'm sure that was something positive, originally.",Leslie Knope

One of us always ends up mad.,Leslie Knope
"I did some research too about the guy who said the thing about me and bowling, and his name is Derek.",Leslie Knope

"His average is 132, according to the most recent available data.",Leslie Knope
"Leslie, that comment wasn't really about whether you're good at bowling",Ben Wyatt
which I am.,Leslie Knope
Ask Ron.,Leslie Knope
Which we all know you are.,Ben Wyatt
But some people have the impression that you're a little elitist or intellectual or something.,Ben Wyatt
That is so sexist.,Leslie Knope
It's just because I'm a woman.,Leslie Knope
"Would they deign to say such things to Woodrow Wilson or Benjamin Disraeli okay, I see what you're talking about.",Leslie Knope

She's just doing this for the money.,Leslie Knope
She doesn't even like her own client.,Leslie Knope

Or the real best case scenario is if she just takes the money and doesn't even try.,Ben Wyatt
Tell me a little bit about Leslie Knope.,Perd Hapley
"Well, Perd, Leslie Knope represents everything that is wrong about politics in America.",Jennifer Barkley
"She's naive, she's untested, and she's an entrenched bureaucrat that's got the stink of big government all over her.",Jennifer Barkley
"Oh, God.",Ben Wyatt
What?,Leslie Knope
"Wow, strong words from a powerful lady.",Perd Hapley
So I guess we both agree.,Jennifer Barkley

Worst case scenario!,Leslie Knope

What do I do?,Leslie Knope
How do I get from here to there?,Leslie Knope
I'm not a professional mountain climber.,Leslie Knope
"It's a real problem in our town, but not any more, thanks to Ramp Up Pawnee.",Leslie Knope
"We're going to put ramps in every building in this town because if there's one thing I believe, it's that stairs are a young man's game.",Leslie Knope
Yeah.,Extra
Ramps are an idiot's game.,Extra
This is nothing more than a worse version of Bobby Newport's plan.,Extra
What plan?,Leslie Knope
Bobby Newport doesn't have a plan.,Leslie Knope

Maybe we take the fight to her?,Ben Wyatt
"I mean I could try to get you on Perd's show, and you could tell him how she stole your idea.",Ben Wyatt
That sounds good.,Leslie Knope
"Okay, I'll just do that.",Ben Wyatt
"I can call, or maybe I'll just go down there.",Ben Wyatt
Hey.,April Ludgate

Please.,Leslie Knope
Let me get my insults out.,Leslie Knope
I've been practicing it the whole way over here.,Leslie Knope
I sense that you're angry.,Jennifer Barkley
Tell me why.,Jennifer Barkley
"Because you stole my idea, and yours won't even work.",Leslie Knope
"Ramps are more practical, and they're less expensive than lifts.",Leslie Knope
My idea is better.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, I don't doubt it.",Jennifer Barkley
The fact is I don't care.,Jennifer Barkley
"Ramps, lifts, your plan, my plan I don't actually care about any of this.",Jennifer Barkley

So what's Ben's next move for you?,Jennifer Barkley
"Oh, oh, I'm not going to tell you that.",Leslie Knope
"Oh, let me guess.",Jennifer Barkley
"Um, you're going to attack me.",Jennifer Barkley
"You're going to go on that perm show again, so you could tell everyone that that ramp idea was yours.",Jennifer Barkley
"It's ""Perd,"" first of all, and no.",Leslie Knope
Maybe.,Leslie Knope
No.,Leslie Knope
That's not a terrible idea.,Jennifer Barkley
"No, actually, it is kind of terrible because if you go on the air and tell everybody that I stole your idea",Jennifer Barkley
Which you did.,Leslie Knope
"Which I did, everyone's going to think you're a sore loser, a goodygoody nerd.",Jennifer Barkley
Because you know what people don't care about?,Jennifer Barkley
They don't care about whose idea was first.,Jennifer Barkley
They care about whose idea was best.,Jennifer Barkley
"Well, let's say that that was our plan, which it isn't.",Leslie Knope
"Mmhmm, okay.",Jennifer Barkley
What would you do instead?,Leslie Knope
"Oh, Leslie.",Jennifer Barkley
I really shouldn't give you campaign advice.,Jennifer Barkley
Right.,Leslie Knope
"Ah, what the hell.",Jennifer Barkley
"If you love chess, which I do, but you don't have anybody to play against, which I don't, then sometimes, you just gotta play yourself.",Jennifer Barkley
You could attack the Newport plan for costing too much money.,Jennifer Barkley
"No, but that would backfire because then we would just say, ""you can never spend too much on seniors.""",Jennifer Barkley
Of course.,Leslie Knope
You need to beat our idea.,Jennifer Barkley
Come up with something better.,Jennifer Barkley
I don't know.,Jennifer Barkley
Maybe a free shuttle service for seniors.,Jennifer Barkley
"All right, that could work.",Jennifer Barkley
Wow.,Leslie Knope
Waffles and a cappuccino.,Extra
"Gracias, Marta.",Jennifer Barkley
JJ's doesn't have a cappuccino maker.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, it does now.",Jennifer Barkley
I bought them one.,Jennifer Barkley
Course you did.,Leslie Knope
You talked to Barkley without me?,Ben Wyatt
I wanted to tell her what a jerk she was.,Leslie Knope
And then she guessed your plan immediately and demolished it.,Leslie Knope
"Okay, as a rule, you shouldn't take advice from your opponent's campaign manager.",Ben Wyatt
But what if she's right?,Leslie Knope
"Well, what if it's a trick?",Ben Wyatt
"I mean, maybe she thinks our original plan would work, and she convinced you to use her plan instead because she knows that won't work.",Ben Wyatt
"Or maybe she thinks that we think that she thinks that, so we won't do it.",Leslie Knope
But she knows that I know that she knows that She's in our heads.,Leslie Knope
"I'm sorry, Leslie.",Ben Wyatt
She's better at this than I am.,Ben Wyatt
"Hey, there is no one on Earth that I would rather go into battle with than you.",Leslie Knope
Really?,Ben Wyatt
Yes.,Leslie Knope
"So tell me, what do we do, my campaign manager?",Leslie Knope
I don't know.,Ben Wyatt
Okay.,Leslie Knope
I'd like to talk about your future.,Ron Swanson
Why are we on this bench?,Ann Perkins
This is weird.,Ann Perkins
You did a great job solving that problem today.,Ron Swanson
The leadership you displayed has gotten me thinking,Ron Swanson
I didn't solve that problem.,Ann Perkins
April did.,Ann Perkins
Really?,Ron Swanson
Why did she tell me you did?,Ron Swanson
"Because she's April, and she doesn't want you to think that she actually cares about something.",Ann Perkins
"If you're looking for someone to help fill in for Leslie, April's a pain in the ass, but she's clearly the answer.",Ann Perkins
Perhaps you're right.,Ron Swanson
Should I go?,Ann Perkins
"Oh, you're still here?",Ron Swanson
Yes.,Ron Swanson
Let's begin the show by starting it.,Perd Hapley
"Now, Leslie, you claim the Newport campaign stole one of your ideas.",Perd Hapley
"Well, uh They did, they stole our idea.",Leslie Knope
We were working on the Ramp Up Pawnee initiative for many weeks.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, Perd.",Jennifer Barkley
This is politics as usual.,Jennifer Barkley
"The fact is, Bobby Newport's plan is better for seniors, better for Pawnee.",Jennifer Barkley
"Well, our plan is more practical, and it's cheaper.",Leslie Knope
"There she goes again, Perd.",Jennifer Barkley
I don't know where she went the first time.,Perd Hapley
"Bobby Newport cares about better, not cheaper for our seniors.",Jennifer Barkley
And our flash poll seems to agree.,Perd Hapley
Some 78% of those we surveyed prefer the Newport plan to the Knope plan.,Perd Hapley
This is why Ned Jones has endorsed us.,Jennifer Barkley
Let's get back on track.,Jennifer Barkley
I just think our opposition is losing sight of what all this is about.,Jennifer Barkley
"What this is about is Pawnee, and that is what I care about.",Leslie Knope
What Bobby Newport cares about is romping around on some beach in Spain with a floozy.,Leslie Knope
Excuse me?,Jennifer Barkley
"Oh, maybe you hadn't heard of it.",Leslie Knope
"It wasn't in the New York Times or Le Monde, which is what she reads.",Leslie Knope
It was in the Pawnee papers.,Leslie Knope
Bobby Newport's personal life is neither here nor there.,Jennifer Barkley
It's certainly not here.,Leslie Knope
"And I think Pawneeans deserve a city councilor who stays in the city, like I do.",Leslie Knope
"Well, we were going to keep this a secret until we had everything in writing, but Bobby Newport is trying to convince a major European company to open up a factory in Pawnee.",Jennifer Barkley
And that woman that he is with is an anti landmine advocate.,Jennifer Barkley
I didn't realize that you were pro landmine.,Jennifer Barkley
"I am not here to declare a winner, but Jennifer is the winner.",Perd Hapley
Thank you.,Jennifer Barkley
"Now it's time to move onto our next segment, which is a commercial.",Perd Hapley
"I am going to get drunk, and then I'm going to order a three-course meal where each course is made of dessert.",Leslie Knope
She kicked our asses.,Ben Wyatt
Yeah.,Leslie Knope
How are we going to beat her?,Leslie Knope
I don't know.,Ben Wyatt
"I mean, she's like a hurricane.",Ben Wyatt
She's everywhere.,Ben Wyatt
Literally.,Leslie Knope
"Hi, guys.",Jennifer Barkley
You really stepped up your game.,Jennifer Barkley
That was really fun.,Jennifer Barkley
You almost got me.,Jennifer Barkley
I would have if Bobby Newport hadn't gotten those stupid companies to build factories here.,Leslie Knope
"What are you talking about? Oh, that thing I said on the show? Oh, no.",Jennifer Barkley
That was mostly made-up.,Jennifer Barkley
Don't challenge me on that.,Jennifer Barkley
That will backfire.,Jennifer Barkley
"Anyway, enjoy your dinner, guys.",Jennifer Barkley
I already took care of the bill.,Jennifer Barkley
"Another round, please?",Ben Wyatt
Mm-hmm.,Leslie Knope
Nice job on the water fountain.,Ron Swanson
It wasn't me.,April Ludgate
Don't deny it.,Ron Swanson
I know it wasn't the nurse.,Ron Swanson
I'm asking you to step up.,Ron Swanson
"Not replacing Leslie, just picking up some slack.",Ron Swanson
I don't want to do things.,April Ludgate
"I want to not do things, just like you taught me.",April Ludgate
"And I taught you well, but I don't like watching you wasting your brain.",Ron Swanson
And you're too smart to stay my assistant here forever.,Ron Swanson
"I'd rather you start a business or use your hands to farm, but right now, the department needs you.",Ron Swanson
Please.,Ron Swanson
Okay But only because you begged.,April Ludgate
Good girl.,Ron Swanson
Chris Traeger.,Chris Traeger
This is Ron Swanson.,Ron Swanson
April's going to take over some of Leslie's responsibilities.,Ron Swanson
Excellent.,Chris Traeger
I have been a fan of April since day one.,Chris Traeger
I told,Chris Traeger
It's my new interview outfit.,Leslie Knope
"Like, ""hey, nice to meet you.",Leslie Knope
"Can't wait for the interview.""",Leslie Knope
"Um, maybe the maybe the hat.",Ben Wyatt
Yeah.,Ann Perkins
Lose this?,Leslie Knope
"To win an election, you have to be good, and you have to be lucky.",Leslie Knope
"Buddy Wood hosts the number one morning show in Indianapolis, and he wants to interview me for a series he's doing on local elections.",Leslie Knope
And last year the five people that he profiled all won.,Leslie Knope
This is a huge break for us.,Leslie Knope
Um hey.,Ben Wyatt
maybe we should put a pause on the fashion show.,Ben Wyatt
We have to go over your talking points.,Ben Wyatt
Keep going.,Leslie Knope
I can still hear you.,Leslie Knope
"Um, okay, Ms. Knope, what is going to be your first major public works project?",Ben Wyatt
"Oh, I don't know.",Leslie Knope
But I bet these pants will work for the public.,Leslie Knope
Whoo!,Ann Perkins
"Yeah, those pants look dope!",Tom Haverford
Right?,Leslie Knope
"Oh, my God, those look great.",Tom Haverford
And I bet they look even better on Ben's floor.,Tom Haverford
Oh!,Leslie Knope

Wait a second.,Ann Perkins
Just turn around.,Ann Perkins
What?,Leslie Knope
Oh.,Tom Haverford

I think this is it.,Leslie Knope

"No, those endless scarves that come out of your sleeves like a magician.",Leslie Knope
Um I think you should just go with something basic No nonsense.,Ben Wyatt
Mr.,Ben Wyatt
"Wood, hello.",Ben Wyatt

Maybe we should see if he can pull that rod out of his butt and we can hang some of those outfits on it.,Tom Haverford
Ann and I have the occasional rough patch in our relationship.,Tom Haverford
"But right now, we're really in a groove.",Tom Haverford

"Well, like any married couple, honey, your father and I fought occasionally, and sometimes he won the argument, and sometimes I won.",Marlene Griggs-Knope
"But usually, we forgot what we were arguing about and just had sex.",Marlene Griggs-Knope

It was a good quilt.,Leslie Knope
It was an awesome quilt.,Ben Wyatt
"Look, my parents are insane, but they need to be at our wedding.",Ben Wyatt

You need to purge all this stuff that's been building up.,Ann Perkins
"This lesbian nurse is right, Chris.",April Ludgate
You can't keep it all bottled up.,April Ludgate
Maybe you're right.,Chris Traeger

"Well, for that, you're gonna have to visit the bathroom first.",Ann Perkins
Right?,Ann Perkins
No.,April Ludgate
Ann Perkins!,Chris Traeger

So here is the new plan.,Leslie Knope
"I don't expect you to like each other, but you have to come to the wedding, okay? We'll seat you far away from each other.",Leslie Knope
You don't even have to socialize.,Leslie Knope
"Yeah, in fact, we insist that you don't.",Ben Wyatt

I guess he might become insane as he ages.,Leslie Knope
I should keep an eye out for that.,Leslie Knope
"Also, for the record, my unity quilt worked.",Leslie Knope
"So technically, I am three for three with unity quilts.",Leslie Knope
We only have 30 bucks left.,Ben Wyatt
Let's go.,Ben Wyatt

"Get ready, driver.",Leslie Knope
We're gonna make out so hard in the back of your cab.,Leslie Knope

How did you used to slow me down when I was becoming too meish?,Leslie Knope
Sometimes I'd just give you busy work.,Ron Swanson

"Leslie, permission to leave the corner.",Jerry Gergich
Denied.,Leslie Knope
"But, look, I did not lose your speech after all.",Jerry Gergich
I forgot.,Jerry Gergich
I put it in my shoe for safekeeping.,Jerry Gergich
"It's a little moist, but it is still here.",Jerry Gergich
"Well, then how did Kim get the speech?",Leslie Knope
Wait a minute.,Leslie Knope
The Pawnee Sun has been one step ahead of me for months.,Leslie Knope
They knew that Kernston's withdrew its sponsorship of the Commons before I even announced it.,Leslie Knope
They asked me about the sewage eruption in Ramsett Park right after Ron emailed me about it.,Leslie Knope
And Kim asked me if I liked the first season Army Wives just moments after Netflix did.,Leslie Knope
The Pawnee Sun hacked my email.,Leslie Knope
I've been hacked!,Leslie Knope
"Okay, smashing your phone won't stop hacking.",Donna Meagle
That's also my phone.,Jerry Gergich
"Jerry, quiet!",Leslie Knope
This is serious.,Leslie Knope
"Well, the police said they're gonna launch an investigation to see whether or not I was hacked.",Leslie Knope
"But it's very complicated, and it could take up to a month.",Leslie Knope
There is nothing more disgusting than an invasion of privacy.,Chris Traeger
And I should know.,Chris Traeger
I've had many women steal my undershirts.,Chris Traeger
I have a press conference about the Pawnee Commons in two hours.,Leslie Knope
"So I need to go through every email that I've ever sent, ever.",Leslie Knope
I need to know what they might use against me.,Leslie Knope
You can't hack into a typewriter.,Ron Swanson
That's all I have to say.,Ron Swanson
"Can it, Unabomber.",Leslie Knope
This is an emergency.,Leslie Knope
"Hey, Ben.",Andy Dwyer
Hi.,Ben Wyatt
You wanted to talk to me?,Andy Dwyer
Or probably not.,Andy Dwyer
"I mean, I don't even want to talk to me.",Andy Dwyer
"No, I wanted to talk to you.",Ben Wyatt
Oh.,Andy Dwyer
"I just wanted to thank you so much for your help, Andy.",Ben Wyatt
Sorry we didn't wind up choosing the after school music program.,Ben Wyatt
I totally get it.,Andy Dwyer
"The music program would be effective, but the ambulance is gonna help people right now who are in trouble and will probably look good in the media.",Andy Dwyer
"Yeah, that's exactly right.",Ben Wyatt
"Your morning tea, Mr. Wyatt.",Extra
Imagine all the money you could save if you didn't have to pay for this expensive stuff.,Andy Dwyer
Am I right?,Andy Dwyer
"You could help, like, a zillion more charities.",Andy Dwyer
"Yeah, that's also exactly right.",Ben Wyatt
I feel like I should have thought of that.,Ben Wyatt
"Well, let me tell you something else that's interesting, Ben.",Andy Dwyer
What?,Ben Wyatt
I farted five minutes ago.,Andy Dwyer
Didn't even smell it till just now.,Andy Dwyer
That's how tight my pants are.,Andy Dwyer
"Anyhow Later days, dudes.",Andy Dwyer
"Okay, nothing too bad so far.",Leslie Knope
"There's a ""Top Ten Ben's butt 2012 slide show.""",Donna Meagle
You emailed it to Ben and Ann And The Huffington Post?,Donna Meagle
"Yeah, I'm not embarrassed by that.",Leslie Knope
Who is Todo Toadfoot?,Ron Swanson
"You wrote him an email about riding your dragons to Pelennor Fields and signed it ""Dimple Broadbelt of Buckland.""",Ron Swanson
"Yes, that's Ben and my fantasy Lord Of The Rings pen pal letters.",Leslie Knope
I am a little embarrassed by that.,Leslie Knope
"Here's one to me, and it just says ""Thanks.""",Chris Traeger
You're welcome.,Chris Traeger
"Oh, great, I got a new email about the parking lot at the Pawnee Commons.",Leslie Knope
I keep getting emails all the time!,Leslie Knope
I have to do well at this press conference!,Leslie Knope
Donna!,Leslie Knope
"Listen, freaky.",Donna Meagle
Every single one of my boyfriends has tried to hack into my email.,Donna Meagle
I've got an idea Everybody out.,Donna Meagle
"Ann Perkins, I see you behind that attractive purse.",Chris Traeger
You haven't returned any of my calls.,Chris Traeger
"Yeah, that's because, uh, I'm mortified.",Ann Perkins
I'm so sorry that I was so weird and blunt.,Ann Perkins
I am touched and honored that you would even consider me to be the father of your child.,Chris Traeger
And I'm glad that you came right out and said it.,Chris Traeger
"I mean, if we're really considering this, then we have to start at a place of complete honesty.",Chris Traeger
You're right.,Ann Perkins
And I'll start now.,Ann Perkins
You are a great specimen.,Ann Perkins
That's a terrible choice of words.,Ann Perkins
If my baby turned out to be anything like you I'd be lucky.,Ann Perkins
Can I have just a little bit of time to think about it?,Chris Traeger
"Of course, yes.",Ann Perkins
Take as much time as you want.,Ann Perkins
"Or just maybe, like, a couple days.",Ann Perkins
'Cause I'm getting antsy.,Ann Perkins
And I'm ovulating on Thursday.,Ann Perkins
"So, chop-chop.",Ann Perkins
But take your time.,Ann Perkins
"Wear loose pants! I gotta tell you, Ron.",Ann Perkins
You were absolutely and totally right.,Ann Perkins
I know.,Ron Swanson
Stop talking and get out.,Ron Swanson
Yep.,Ann Perkins
The redneck ambulance is a great choice.,Jessica Wicks
We can release a publicity shot of a bucktoothed hayseed taking medicine for the first time in his life.,Jessica Wicks
We can figure out the photo later.,Ben Wyatt
"Oh, I forgot! It's Fondue Friday.",Jessica Wicks
Yay!,Jessica Wicks
"Yeah, also, as President of the foundation, I'm making a few changes.",Ben Wyatt
I'm giving up this office.,Ben Wyatt
And no more visits from a masseuse or fancy lunches.,Ben Wyatt
It's way out of hand.,Ben Wyatt
"Sweetie, all the money we spend on the foundation is tax deductible.",Jessica Wicks
"I know, and it's a huge waste of money.",Ben Wyatt
"I mean, there's plenty of cheap office space around.",Ben Wyatt
And I have an idea for how to use some of the money we'll save.,Ben Wyatt
Get yourself a matching nude portrait? I can call the painter.,Jessica Wicks
Please don't.,Ben Wyatt
"First, I'd like you all to check under your chairs.",Leslie Knope
I think you might be surprised and excited by what you find.,Leslie Knope
Is it chocolate?,Shauna Malwae-Tweep
Even better.,Leslie Knope
It's dirt.,Leslie Knope
"The EPA has recently reviewed our soil samples, and they determined that we achieved, and I quote, ""Minimal acceptable standards.""",Leslie Knope
So not too shabby.,Leslie Knope
"Uh, Councilwoman Knope, you've claimed construction will take 18 months, but a source tells me it will be much longer.",Kim Terlando
I would I would deny that report.,Leslie Knope
I've also learned that the EPA found midi-chlorians in the soil.,Kim Terlando
"How serious is that, exactly?",Kim Terlando
"It's very serious, Kim.",Leslie Knope
"It's almost as serious as email hacking, which is what you have been doing to me for weeks.",Leslie Knope
I really thought you guys would gasp there.,Leslie Knope
That is a baseless accusation.,Kim Terlando
Midi-chlorians are a fictional substance found in the blood of Jedi knights from the movie Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.,Leslie Knope
"Which, side-note, was a terrible movie.",Leslie Knope
"It almost destroyed the franchise, according to my husband.",Leslie Knope
But that is neither here nor there.,Leslie Knope
"The point is I sent Councilwoman Knope the fake email about the EPA finding midi-chlorians, an hour ago As a trap.",Donna Meagle
Into which you have fallen.,Donna Meagle
"Well I have never seen Star Wars, because I was too busy hooking up with guys.",Kim Terlando
Unlike you losers.,Kim Terlando
"Uh, you wanna compare numbers, Terlando? Get to steppin'.",Donna Meagle
"I would just like to point out that Kim Terlando stole all of my jokes for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch, and they were great jokes.",Leslie Knope
So I spent the whole night writing new ones.,Leslie Knope
"Lucky for you, let's get started.",Leslie Knope
I'm very excited to be here.,Leslie Knope
You know who else is excited to be here?,Leslie Knope
Neve Campbell.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, boy.",Donna Meagle
What a great party of five.,Leslie Knope
"All right, thank you, guys.",Donna Meagle
"The point is, I could use someone to help me at the foundation as a part-time assistant but also an idea man.",Ben Wyatt
Might I suggest Tom? He loves ideas.,Andy Dwyer
Also a man.,Andy Dwyer
"What No, Andy, I've already chosen the person.",Ben Wyatt
And it is not Tom,Ben Wyatt
Then who is it?,Andy Dwyer
"Well, he is, uh, sitting right here in this courtyard.",Andy Dwyer
That guy? Do you even know him?,Andy Dwyer
"Oh, my God, Andy, it's you.",Ben Wyatt
I think you may have a knack for charitable giving.,Ben Wyatt
Will you come work for me? Uh-oh.,Ben Wyatt
What's happening? Oh.,Ben Wyatt
"RentASwag shareholders: As you can see, your store is hoppin'.",Tom Haverford

Thank you so much for hiring MonaLisa.,Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
It means so much to me.,Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
"Even though, honestly, she's The wooorst.",Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
She is the worst person in the world.,Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
Huge skank.,Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
Terrible.,Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
But thank you.,Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
It means a lot.,Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
Of course.,Tom Haverford
Got to keep it in the family.,Tom Haverford
"Yeah, but does it have to be this family?",Ben Wyatt
"Actually, that reminds me, Bababa boss man I need to leave early today because my shrink got me and him tickets to a Pitbull concert.",Mona-Lisa Saperstein
And I already committed to that.,Mona-Lisa Saperstein
"And so if you say that I can't go, it's like you're taking something away from me.",Mona-Lisa Saperstein
"Um, store's really busy.",Tom Haverford
I kinda need you to stay.,Tom Haverford
Mmhmm.,Mona-Lisa Saperstein
I totally hear you.,Mona-Lisa Saperstein
"Um, I also don't like what you're saying.",Mona-Lisa Saperstein
"So if you say no, I will start a fire in the bathroom.",Mona-Lisa Saperstein
"Okay, I guess you can go.",Tom Haverford
"Yeah, I know I can.",Mona-Lisa Saperstein

How are you?,Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
Hello.,Dennis Lerpiss
Welcome to Pawnee Videodome.,Dennis Lerpiss
Today we'll be screening Stanley Kubrick's 1957 classic Paths Of Glory.,Dennis Lerpiss
It's about three men who refuse to go on a suicide mission and are executed for cowardice.,Dennis Lerpiss
"Or we could, you know, maybe screen a different movie.",Leslie Knope
One that's a little bit more upbeat.,Leslie Knope
Like Finding Nemo or,Leslie Knope
"I could do, uh, Shoah.",Dennis Lerpiss
"Okay,Paths Of Glory it is.",Leslie Knope
This is the Pawnee Videodome.,Leslie Knope
And we are here because I started a program to help local business.,Leslie Knope
This is a Pawnee institution.,Leslie Knope
"This is the place where Perd Hapley shot his movie review show Lights, Camera, Perd.",Leslie Knope
"It's a heartwarming story, but it's just not believable.",Perd Hapley
Which is why I give E.T. 1 and a 1/2 stars.,Perd Hapley
"Andy, it's over.",Leslie Knope
"Get up, Andy.",Leslie Knope
What are you doing?,Andy Dwyer
What's everybody where are we?,Andy Dwyer
The reason I love that film is that it's really depressing.,Dennis Lerpiss
"Speaking of which, sadly, next month, Pawnee Videodome will be closing its doors.",Dennis Lerpiss
Forever.,Dennis Lerpiss
No!,Leslie Knope
"For those of you that have attended our screenings, I want to thank you for your patronage, though I wish you would have rented more movies.",Dennis Lerpiss
"Guys, we have to help out Dennis and his business.",Leslie Knope
"Everybody rent something, so we can help Dennis.",Leslie Knope
"Sir, will you rent something?",Leslie Knope
Why would I do that?,Morris
All movies are online for free.,Morris
I'm watching Iron Man 2 on my phone right now.,Morris
"Okay, you're not helping.",Leslie Knope
"I, for one, am going to rent Finding Nemo.",Leslie Knope
"Ooh, we don't carry cartoons.",Dennis Lerpiss
"But if you want a film about the ocean, we have a documentary about the brutality of Japan's whaling industry.",Dennis Lerpiss
It's called Tears Of My Blowhole.,Dennis Lerpiss
And it's it's nauseating.,Dennis Lerpiss
I'll just buy some red vines.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, we only have Japanese slime candy and, um, Bulgarian wheat balls.",Dennis Lerpiss
"Leslie, seriously, where are we?",Andy Dwyer
All these kids have fathers and mothers who have birthed them and are guiding them through life.,Chris Traeger
"Yep, that's how it works.",Ben Wyatt
How are you feeling?,Ben Wyatt
Did you make your dadcision yet?,Ben Wyatt
I am 100% certain that I am 0% sure of what I'm going to do.,Chris Traeger
"Ann Perkins asked me if I would like to donate sperm, so she can have a baby.",Chris Traeger
It's a battle between my primal desire to bring a child into this world and my paralyzing fear of negatively affecting any living thing.,Chris Traeger
There's 60 dollars missing from the register.,Tom Haverford
I think MonaLisa's stealing from me.,Tom Haverford
"Yeah, it is absolutely MonaLisa.",Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
She's a total klepto.,Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
And nympho and pyro all those things.,Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
"Okay, as your CFO, I recommend getting rid of her immediately.",Ben Wyatt
I'm throwing a huge cocktail party tomorrow for all my best clients.,Tom Haverford
I don't have time to find someone new.,Tom Haverford
This sucks.,Tom Haverford
"You know, when I was in high school, we had to spend a week carrying around a sack of flour, pretending it was a kid.",Ben Wyatt
"Why don't you make Tom your sack of flour, see how it feels to parent him a little?",Ben Wyatt
"Ben, that is literally the greatest idea in human history.",Chris Traeger
"I heard ""sack of flour"" and ""high school.""",Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
Are you dingdongs making fake drugs for sophomores?,Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
"Because if true, this guy wants in.",Jean-Ralphio Saperstein
"Yeah, just have Mr. Traeger call me when he gets back in.",Ann Perkins
"Actually, you know what?",Ann Perkins
Don't tell him that I called.,Ann Perkins
"Just when he gets there, can you text me and tell me he's back?",Ann Perkins
You know what?,Ann Perkins
"Let's just pretend this didn't happen, okay?",Ann Perkins
This is Jerry Gergich calling.,Ann Perkins
Bye.,Ann Perkins
I have to tell you a secret.,April Ludgate
"But if you tell anyone, I will kill you slowly with a giant syringe.",April Ludgate
"Good morning, April.",Ann Perkins
What's your secret?,Ann Perkins
I'm thinking about applying to veterinary school in Bloomington.,April Ludgate
"Oh, my God, April, that's great!",Ann Perkins
Whoa!,Ann Perkins
Where'd you get that?,Ann Perkins
The Internet.,April Ludgate
So I really need a letter of recommendation.,April Ludgate
"And since you work in a hospital, as a janitor",April Ludgate
Nurse.,Ann Perkins
I was wondering if maybe you would write one for me?,April Ludgate
Really?,Ann Perkins
"Generally, between us, April always has the upper hand.",Ann Perkins
And that hand is usually giving me the finger or pouring honey in my purse.,Ann Perkins
But now I have the upper hand.,Ann Perkins
And I'm going to use it to crush her Into being nice to me.,Ann Perkins
I would be happy to write you that letter.,Ann Perkins
I actually know the guy who runs the veterinary program over there.,Ann Perkins
Because you hooked up with him?,April Ludgate
I don't hook up with everyone I know.,Ann Perkins
"Although, yes, we did hook up.",Ann Perkins
"But before I write you that letter, you have to spend the next week with me and do everything I say.",Ann Perkins
So I have to be your slave or something?,April Ludgate
"No, you have to be my friend.",Ann Perkins
"No, that is so much worse.",April Ludgate
Don't do that.,Ann Perkins
I think I have a plan of how to save your store.,Leslie Knope
"If we get the Pawnee Historical Society to declare your store as a historical landmark, then you might get enough of a tax break to keep your business afloat.",Leslie Knope
That sounds like the government meddling in private enterprise.,Ron Swanson
"Well, Ron, we all know how much you love the free market.",Leslie Knope
But the Pawnee Videodome is the only place in town where people gather to do something intellectual.,Leslie Knope
That and the slam poetry nights at Beanie's Coffee.,Leslie Knope
But I do not count those because those poems do not rhyme.,Leslie Knope
Anything can be a slam poem if you say it like this.,Leslie Knope
It's pointless.,Leslie Knope
This man is a failure.,Ron Swanson
He is not up to snuff.,Ron Swanson
"His business is failing, and you're bailing it out.",Ron Swanson
"This is a bailout, and I don't like it.",Ron Swanson
And there are some pretty intellectual conversations down at Barrett's Hardware.,Ron Swanson
"You may get a little heat for this, okay?",Leslie Knope
So use your money wisely.,Leslie Knope
Get popular films that people wanna see.,Leslie Knope
"Like, uh, get the Tarkovsky movies with the subtitles.",Dennis Lerpiss
No.,Leslie Knope
Like Pixar.,Leslie Knope
Reese Witherspoon.,Leslie Knope
"I know this is gonna hurt, but maybe some Michael Bay.",Leslie Knope
What?,Dennis Lerpiss
"No, no.",Dennis Lerpiss
No.,Dennis Lerpiss
"Tom, I have something I need to talk to you about.",Chris Traeger
Do we need to sit like this?,Tom Haverford
Yes.,Chris Traeger
MonaLisa's taking advantage of you.,Chris Traeger
And I'm sure that it's not easy when it's the sister of a dear friend.,Chris Traeger
"Oh, no, it's not that.",Tom Haverford
She scares the crap out of me.,Tom Haverford
I once saw her punch a police horse in the face.,Tom Haverford
"Speak directly to her and tell her, ""I will not be disrespected.""",Chris Traeger
You're Tom Haverford.,Chris Traeger
"You're a smart, successful young man with an adorable, little belly.",Chris Traeger
Stand up for yourself.,Chris Traeger
"Yeah, I'll talk to her before the party.",Tom Haverford
"And if she murders me, tell JeanRalphio to clear my browser history.",Tom Haverford
"Thanks for the advice, man.",Tom Haverford
You're welcome.,Chris Traeger
Son.,Chris Traeger
What's that?,Tom Haverford
Nothing.,Chris Traeger
All right.,Tom Haverford
Pawnee Videodome is where I rented my first Bruce Lee movie.,Andy Dwyer
And my second Bruce Lee movie.,Andy Dwyer
"And when I was in seventh grade, I went out back in the alley behind the store, and there was a giant hornet's nest.",Andy Dwyer
"And I threw a rock at it, and it exploded.",Andy Dwyer
And hornets came out.,Andy Dwyer
Andy,Leslie Knope
"The point is, obviously, you do not throw rocks at a hornet's nest.",Andy Dwyer
"And the point is also that the Pawnee Videodome is a place with tremendous community value, where people gather to expand their horizons.",Leslie Knope
Any other comments here before we Ron?,Leslie Knope
What are you doing at a city council meeting?,Leslie Knope
Are you lost?,Leslie Knope
Are you hurt?,Leslie Knope
"No, I am here to express an opinion.",Ron Swanson
This action by Councilwoman Knope is nothing more than a thinly veiled government bailout.,Ron Swanson
"And I, for one, refuse to let her turn this town into a socialist hellscape.",Ron Swanson
Allow me to elaborate.,Ron Swanson
The government should not prop up a failed business.,Ron Swanson
That would be like giving food to a mortally wounded animal instead of slitting its throat and properly utilizing its meat and pelt.,Ron Swanson
Please stop talking about wounded meat.,Leslie Knope
Pawnee needs a place where the community can gather to discuss and appreciate art.,Leslie Knope
A place where you can rent such films as Cinema Paradiso or Rashomon.,Leslie Knope
You rented Rashomon?,Ron Swanson
What was your favorite part of that?,Ron Swanson
"I haven't rented it, actually, yet.",Leslie Knope
But I like the idea that there is a place where I could rent Rashomon.,Leslie Knope
"Uh, you can just watch it online, for free, whenever you want.",Morris
Bailiff!,Leslie Knope
"Thank you, Mr. Swanson, for your absurd opinion, which is shared by no one.",Leslie Knope
"Now, are there any more public comments before we vote?",Leslie Knope
Mm.,Leslie Knope
How much to rent this jacket?,Extra
Oh.,Mona-Lisa Saperstein
"Curly Sue, that jacket is so ugly.",Mona-Lisa Saperstein
You should just take it.,Mona-Lisa Saperstein
"It's 15 for the day, 40 for the week. Thank you.",Tom Haverford
We appreciate your business.,Tom Haverford
MonaLisa!,Tom Haverford
Did you order the champagne for the client party tonight?,Tom Haverford
"Did I order the what for the what what what, what?",Mona-Lisa Saperstein
What are you even talking about right now?,Mona-Lisa Saperstein
"Okay, we need to discuss your work habits.",Tom Haverford
"Okay, sure, but after I take a quick nap because ecstasy takes forever to leave my system",Mona-Lisa Saperstein
No.,Tom Haverford
We're doing this now.,Tom Haverford
You need to start putting in more of an effort and start respecting my authority around here!,Tom Haverford
Or else what?,Mona-Lisa Saperstein
Or else I'll fire you.,Tom Haverford
What did you just say?,Mona-Lisa Saperstein
"I said, if you don't shape up, I'll fire you.",Tom Haverford
Do you understand?,Tom Haverford
"You are so freaking sexy right now, I could crap my pants.",Mona-Lisa Saperstein
Ugh.,Tom Haverford
What are you doing?,Tom Haverford
"I guess it would have to be Channing Tatum's body, Ryan Gosling's face, and Michael Fassbender's sense of humor.",Ann Perkins
What about you?,Ann Perkins
Build your perfect guy.,Ann Perkins
"Um Yao Ming's torso, Napoleon's brain, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame's hunchback.",April Ludgate
Do you like my nails?,April Ludgate
"Even though she hides it underneath layers of sarcasm, resentment, and grumpiness, I know, deep down somewhere, April likes me.",Ann Perkins
I'm kind of just fracking for friendship.,Ann Perkins
"Gene Strackwell, owner of Strackwell Hardware.",Extra
Is there a form I need to fill out for the bailout?,Extra
We're not bailing anyone out.,Leslie Knope
Pawnee Videodome is receiving historical landmark status.,Leslie Knope
We've been around way longer than that stupid art house movie bullcrap.,Extra
And people need places to buy tools.,Extra
"Uh, you can just buy tools online.",Morris
"Bailiff, why is he back in here?",Leslie Knope
How did you get back in here?,Leslie Knope
I'll see myself out.,Morris
Don't worry about it.,Morris
I heard you were giving out free money.,Joe From Sewage
"I need $3,000.",Joe From Sewage
Minimum.,Joe From Sewage
"Mr. Fantringham, the city of Pawnee is not gonna give you a personal loan.",Leslie Knope
"What would you do if one of your citizens was about to come into some serious physical harm Unless he got 3,000 dollars?",Joe From Sewage
I'd call the police.,Leslie Knope
You cannot call the police.,Joe From Sewage
"Wilson Gromling of the ""Liberty or Die"" party.",Extra
These government handouts are deplorable.,Extra
You're just handing out blank checks.,Extra
I was on food stamps.,Extra
I was on Welfare.,Extra
And nobody ever helped me.,Extra
This is not a blank check.,Leslie Knope
I have given specific instructions to the Pawnee Videodome about how they are going to spend their money.,Leslie Knope
"In a few days, Dennis will reopen.",Leslie Knope
"The store will serve a wider range of Pawnee's citizens, and a Pawnee cultural institution will be saved.",Leslie Knope
Are there any other comments?,Councilman Howser
Yes.,Extra
"The Pawnee chapter of the ""Liberty or Die"" party has hit some hard times.",Extra

"I told her she needed to change her attitude, or I was gonna have to fire her.",Tom Haverford
"Well, that is very responsible and mature.",Ben Wyatt
She took it well?,Ben Wyatt
Um yeah.,Tom Haverford
"For some reason, she got super turned on.",Tom Haverford
We started making out.,Tom Haverford
Hard.,Tom Haverford
"Next thing you know, we're back at my place, having sex.",Tom Haverford
We're together now.,Tom Haverford
"Hey, bitch, I need to borrow some money to do something that is none of your damn beeswax, namely, I need to wax my bee.",Mona-Lisa Saperstein
Here you go.,Tom Haverford
I'd still hit it.,Mona-Lisa Saperstein
I'm coolin' on you.,Mona-Lisa Saperstein
See?,Tom Haverford
Perfect!,Tom Haverford
"Okay, you have to choose one.",Ann Perkins
I can't think.,April Ludgate
These braids you did are making my brain hurt.,April Ludgate
Fine.,April Ludgate

Hey.,Dennis Lerpiss
You did it!,Leslie Knope
We did it!,Leslie Knope
I did it.,Leslie Knope
This is me.,Leslie Knope

Andy?,April Ludgate
That's my husband.,April Ludgate
"They were still extremely graphic, and appreciated by all of us.",Councilman Dexhart
"I had never heard of several of those terms, and I'm a freak.",Councilman Dexhart
Those are personal.,April Ludgate
No one's allowed to read those.,April Ludgate
You once posted a video of yourself drinking alcohol in City Hall while you were still a minor.,Jeremy Jamm
How do you justify that?,Jeremy Jamm
Easily.,April Ludgate
Alcohol is delicious and fun,April Ludgate
Damentally a substance that should not be abused.,Leslie Knope
"I agree, April.",Leslie Knope
Very good point.,Leslie Knope
Wow.,Jeremy Jamm
"Ms. Ludgate, are you a ventriloquist?",Jeremy Jamm
"I mean, that is amazing how you make your words come out of Ms. Knope's mouth.",Jeremy Jamm
Would you like to put her on your knee?,Jeremy Jamm
"I mean, that'd be really fun.",Jeremy Jamm
"Just three years ago, you drove",Jeremy Jamm
She is not ready.,Chris Traeger
"Now, you've rushed her into this, and now, Jamm's sharpening the knives.",Chris Traeger
"Leslie, no one needs to be jammed today.",Chris Traeger
"Okay, all we need is some kind of distraction.",Leslie Knope
Grab that gavel and break your other foot.,Leslie Knope
"I like the idea of double the signings, but I think the negatives outweigh the positives.",Chris Traeger
Don't panic.,Leslie Knope
Maybe she can pull this off.,Leslie Knope
"I guess my first move as director would be to fill your office, house, and car with snakes, and then train a crow to fly up your butt.",April Ludgate
Okay! Let's take a brief recess.,Leslie Knope
"Well, well, well.",Dennis Feinstein
Look who's back.,Dennis Feinstein
"Thank you so much for seeing us again, sir.",Ben Wyatt
We just came to apologize.,Ben Wyatt
"Mr. Dennis Feinstein, let me just say, from the bottom of my heart, my bad.",Andy Dwyer
"I just started working here, and I really want to do a good job, and I blew it.",Andy Dwyer
Thank you for saying that.,Dennis Feinstein
"Thought about it last night, and I decided that if you came in here and apologized to me like a man, that I would forgive you, and that's what you've done, so you're forgiven.",Dennis Feinstein
"To that end, here is a check for 25,000 dollars for your charity.",Dennis Feinstein
"Go out there and help some kids with their pink eye, or whatever it is you guys are doing.",Dennis Feinstein
"Mr. Feinstein, thank you.",Ben Wyatt
This is extremely generous.,Ben Wyatt
"It's nothing, really.",Dennis Feinstein
I'm happy to help.,Dennis Feinstein

Your blood pressure looks fine.,Ann Perkins
"I'm not sure how this is possible, but your cholesterol is 120, which is the lowest I've ever seen.",Ann Perkins
"What's ""cholesterol""?",Ron Swanson
"And the only problem I see is that your potassium's low, so just eat a banana once in awhile.",Ann Perkins
"No, thank you.",Ron Swanson
"I live the way I live, I eat the things I eat, and I'll die the way I'll die.",Ron Swanson
That's oddly beautiful but also stupid.,Ann Perkins
"You're not alone in the world anymore, Ron.",Ann Perkins
"You're dating a woman who has two kids, so every three days, think about Ivy and Zoe and Diane, and eat a damn banana.",Ann Perkins
"I am so sorry, April.",Leslie Knope
"You are doing terribly up there, and it's all my fault.",Leslie Knope
"It's not you, it's me.",Leslie Knope
Are you breaking up with me?,April Ludgate
I'm breaking up with the idea of you being director of Animal Control.,Leslie Knope
I say we just withdraw your application and let Vern become director.,Leslie Knope
He does have good teeth.,Leslie Knope
"No! All right, I have an idea.",April Ludgate
Trust me.,April Ludgate
"Ms. Ludgate, it is the opinion of this committee that you are terrible.",Jeremy Jamm
Can you give me even one reason why you're the right man for this job?,Jeremy Jamm
No.,April Ludgate
But neither is your guy.,April Ludgate
Neither of us should get the job.,April Ludgate
"Oh, no? Why is that?",Jeremy Jamm
There shouldn't be a separate Animal Control Department.,April Ludgate
"Its budget is tiny, and it's ineffective, and frankly, no one could change that.",April Ludgate
So I think it should be absorbed into the Parks Department.,April Ludgate
That is a genius idea.,Leslie Knope
Somebody wake up Milton.,Leslie Knope
History is being made.,Leslie Knope
Iwo Jima!,Councilman Milton
"Animal Control would be way more effective if it ran through the Parks Department, and if you want, I can write up an official report in language simple enough for even you dummies to understand, dummies.",April Ludgate
"Councilman, you have to admit that that idea makes a lot of sense.",Chris Traeger
Hang on a second.,Jeremy Jamm
"You seem to be forgetting that I already told Vern he got the job, and he already bought a new speedboat.",Jeremy Jamm
"Well, I hope he kept a receipt.",Leslie Knope
"That was a brilliant idea from a dark, tortured genius, and I move that Animal Control be absorbed into Parks and Rec.",Leslie Knope
I second that.,Councilman Howser
Yay!,Leslie Knope
"Look at that, April.",Leslie Knope
You won over Jamm.,Leslie Knope
"Uh, no, she didn't.",Jeremy Jamm
I'm just sick of being on the losing side.,Jeremy Jamm
I'm going to tell everyone this was my idea.,Jeremy Jamm
Retro-jammed.,Jeremy Jamm
What do we do now? Can I apologize again? I'm getting really at apologizing.,Andy Dwyer
Screw that.,Tom Haverford
You should apologize for apologizing to that guy.,Tom Haverford
"God, we really could've used the money, though.",Ben Wyatt
Just wish we'd made a bigger impression.,Ben Wyatt
"You did-- I was really impressed by all the stuff the foundation's done for all them poor homies, so you know what? Rent-A-Swag is gonna donate five cents from every dollar we make this month.",Tom Haverford
"It's not Feinstein money, but it'll help.",Tom Haverford
"That's very generous, Tom.",Ben Wyatt
Feinstein's the worst.,Ben Wyatt
I hope he gets into an accident driving that Rolex Mobile.,Ben Wyatt
"For the last time, it's a Rolexus, and you can't drive it.",Tom Haverford
"April, I have a gift for you.",Leslie Knope
Ta da.,Leslie Knope
"At Leslie's suggestion, I have made you deputy director of Animal Control within the Parks Department.",Chris Traeger
"You'll be amazing at it, and the best part, there is no confirmation hearing.",Chris Traeger
How did you make this plaque so quickly?,April Ludgate
I had it made your first week here.,Leslie Knope
"I knew you'd be going places, so I wanted to be prepared.",Leslie Knope
Can I hire an intern?,April Ludgate
Not yet.,Leslie Knope
Can I hire a Mexican elf?,April Ludgate
No.,Leslie Knope
Can I buy a child bride?,April Ludgate
No.,Leslie Knope
Then how is this even a promotion?,April Ludgate
Government shouldn't operate based on personal favors.,Leslie Knope
It should operate based on good ideas.,Leslie Knope
"April had the best idea, and today the best idea won.",Leslie Knope
"Leslie, I really have to go to the bathroom.",Chris Traeger
"Oh, yeah, right, sorry.",Leslie Knope
You don't have to come in with me.,Chris Traeger

"Today is Ted Party Day, where we commemorate the great Pawnee tea dump of 1817.",Leslie Knope
"Historical fun fact when the Founding Fathers wrote the charter, their oldtimey script made one of the ""a""s look like a ""d,"" so ""tea"" became ""Ted.""",Leslie Knope

I'm not getting dumped in that lake anymore.,Theodore
"And I talked to the other Teds in town, and they're not doing it either.",Theodore
"Come on, Ted Party Day is protected by Article Two in the town charter.",Leslie Knope
"And we have the right, nay, the obligation, to dump Ted into the lake every year.",Leslie Knope
That's the way it's always been done.,Leslie Knope
"Okay, first of all, ""That's the way it's always been done"" is not a good reason to keep doing something.",Theodore
"Second, it was a misprint.",Theodore
"They clearly meant ""tea.""",Theodore
I just think you need to be careful about speculating what the Founders meant when they were writing the town charter.,Leslie Knope
"Okay, fine.",Theodore
You want to enforce every single old law we have on our books?,Theodore
"Hey, can I see your keys for a second?",Theodore
Here's a quarter.,Theodore
I own your car now.,Theodore
Wha,Tom Haverford
Sorry.,Theodore
The Pawnee Charter clearly states that any white citizen has the right to seize any Indian property for 25 cents.,Theodore
That is an outdated and racist law.,Leslie Knope
"And obviously they meant ""American Indian.""",Leslie Knope
"Whoa, I think we should be careful when we speculate what the Founders intended when they wrote the charter.",Theodore
"Okay, Ted.",Leslie Knope

Yes.,Ron Swanson
"Normally, if given a choice between doing something and nothing, I'd choose to do nothing.",Ron Swanson
But I will do something if it helps someone else do nothing.,Ron Swanson
I'd work all night if it meant nothing got done.,Ron Swanson
"Ron Swanson and April Ludgate, literally my two favorite people in the catalogued universe.",Chris Traeger
April will not be participating in your pointless course because she has more important things to do like not participating in your pointless course.,Ron Swanson

Yes.,Ron Swanson
Cool.,Donna Meagle
Got it.,Tom Haverford
"Okay, now let's not read anything.",Leslie Knope
That's an invasion of his privacy.,Leslie Knope
Let's just look at his browser history and his inbox and his outbox and his Facebook page.,Leslie Knope
"Yeah, he doesn't have any new emails.",Andy Dwyer
"Oh, my God.",Tom Haverford
It's true.,Tom Haverford
He hasn't gotten an email in 12 days. Is he a ghost?,Tom Haverford
The only ones he gets are spam.,Tom Haverford
And he responds to them.,Tom Haverford
I think I'm gonna be sick.,Tom Haverford
"Oh, man.",Leslie Knope
This guy has no friends.,Leslie Knope
I don't know.,Andy Dwyer
Seems like he's friends with that mule.,Andy Dwyer

How would you feel about going in on the waffle iron together?,Ben Wyatt
Seriously?,Ann Perkins

"Dude, whatever it is, I'm in.",Ann Perkins
"Okay, great.",Ben Wyatt
What should I do with this?,Ann Perkins
Just burn it and bury the ashes and pray it doesn't haunt you.,Ben Wyatt

No.,Leslie Knope
I was wondering would you like to join the Pawnee Historical Commission?,Leslie Knope
Those clowns? No thank you.,Garth Blunden
They haven't answered a single one of my complaints about their anachronistic use of fonts in their newsletter.,Garth Blunden
"Well, I'm a member, and I think we could really use you.",Leslie Knope
"But the only problem is there's tons of meetings, lots of work with people who also love history, and many social occasions that you're gonna have to attend, like cocktail parties and such.",Leslie Knope
I can understand if it's something you don't want to commit to.,Leslie Knope
Just sounds like such a big bite out of my soap-making time.,Garth Blunden

Seems to me we ought to use it.,Leslie Knope
"I did not change Article Two, though.",Leslie Knope
"I just couldn't vote against a good, old-fashioned lake dunking.",Leslie Knope
Though Garth and I did come up with a compromise that I think will make everybody happy.,Leslie Knope

And the prosecution rests.,Ron Swanson
Not so fast.,Donna Meagle

Not surprising since he was a mess after you talked to him.,Donna Meagle

Mission accomplished.,Ron Swanson
What did April write? Where is April?,Chris Traeger
I will pit Ron and Chris against each other.,April Ludgate

I agree.,Ron Swanson

Point taken.,Leslie Knope
But we have a compromise.,Ben Wyatt

"However, I did not have yellow frosting, so I had to use mustard.",Leslie Knope
But do not worry.,Leslie Knope
"I put tons of sugar on them, so it will even it out.",Leslie Knope
Mmm!,Leslie Knope
Sugar mustard.,Leslie Knope
"That's awful kind of you, Leslie, but I'm afraid those are a little too sweet for me.",Ron Dunn

"This is volcanically hot betrayal! She is my best friend! She's thinking about leaving, just like that!",Leslie Knope
"And she wants to ""talk to me"" about it? It's like, I don't even know what to say.",Leslie Knope
"That you love her and you understand that it's her life, and geography will never change your feelings.",Ron Swanson

"We all know that I cannot spend as much money on ads as my opponent, but I printed out 10,000 ""Don't"" stickers and 10,000 question mark stickers.",Leslie Knope
"That way, if you see a sign and it says ""Recall Knope,"" all you need to do is add the question mark and the ""Don't,"" and suddenly, it reads, ""Recall Knope? Don't.""",Leslie Knope
"Why don't you just put the ""Don't"" in front of ""Recall Knope""?",Donna Meagle
"Yep, that's a much better idea.",Leslie Knope
Can I have these question mark stickers?,April Ludgate
Why?,Leslie Knope
I want to put them on stop signs.,April Ludgate
"April, no!",Leslie Knope
Hi.,Nadia Stasky
"Um, I need to talk to somebody about reserving a park.",Nadia Stasky

"So, Leslie and I just finished putting together our will, and she wants you to be the witness.",Ben Wyatt
You mind signing it?,Ben Wyatt
That's your will?,Ron Swanson
"You need that many pages to say, ""Give my stuff to my wife""?",Ron Swanson

It doesn't have to be.,Ron Swanson
I've had the same will since I was eight years old.,Ron Swanson

I could introduce you to our lawyer.,Ben Wyatt
"The three most useless jobs in the world are, in order, lawyer, congressman, and doctor.",Ron Swanson

Second.,Councilman Dexhart
"Gahhh, you guys are the worst!",Leslie Knope
"Sorry, Knope.",Jeremy Jamm
We're just looking for any possible way to get you recalled because we don't like you.,Jeremy Jamm
It's nothing personal.,Jeremy Jamm
It absolutely is personal.,Leslie Knope
"That is the definition of ""personal.""",Leslie Knope
"""The definition of personal.""",Jeremy Jamm
"Excuse me, we have an issue.",Chris Traeger
"A tweet has been tweeted from the Parks and Rec Twitter, and I'm afraid it is quite sexually graphic.",Chris Traeger
It's probably just some bored teenager who hacked the account.,Leslie Knope
"Whoever it is, it's quite serious.",Chris Traeger
Take a look at this.,Chris Traeger
"I don't want you to get recalled Knope, but damn, these people know how to pick a neck massager.",Donna Meagle
"And before you get on my case about those stickers, I already did 'em.",Donna Meagle
"Donna, there is trouble a-brewin'.",Chris Traeger
We think that you may have accidentally tweeted from the Parks and Rec account rather than your own personal account.,Leslie Knope
Uhoh.,Donna Meagle
What'd it say?,Donna Meagle
"""See you tonight.""",Leslie Knope
"""Hope you like tongue baths, you big, nasty fireman.""",Leslie Knope

Ew.,Leslie Knope
"Not to give you too much of a peek into my personal life, but this could have been way worse.",Donna Meagle
"What's important is, we deleted the tweet, and nobody is gonna know it's you, but Donna, you know, be more careful in the future.",Leslie Knope
This could've really blew up in my face.,Leslie Knope
"I'm here live, at a press conference, where Councilman Jeremy Jamm will discuss a government scandal we are calling ""Twitter Watergate"" until we can find a snappier name for it.",Perd Hapley

You have my word on it!,Jeremy Jamm
Ugh.,Leslie Knope
"Ooh, this is bad.",Donna Meagle
I'm gonna get fired.,Donna Meagle

Check the accountant crap at the door.,Trevor Nelson
"Yes, sir, I will.",Ben Wyatt
Unintentional.,Ben Wyatt
"All right, let's begin.",Jeremy Jamm
These hearings have two goals.,Jeremy Jamm
"One, to find out exactly how this offensive tweet came to be sent.",Jeremy Jamm
"And two, to turn this whole thing into a media circus.",Jeremy Jamm
"Ms. Knope, do you have a statement?",Jeremy Jamm
"Well, it's actually quite simple.",Leslie Knope
"Uh, a Parks and Rec employee forgot to log out of the Parks and Rec Twitter account, they posted a personal, of the Parks and Rec private message by accident, and, uh, that person is very sorry, and it won't happen again.",Leslie Knope

Or them.,Councilman Dexhart
It could be a bunch of hot ladies.,Councilman Dexhart
"Yes, perhaps ""them"" can finally give us the answers we need.",Jeremy Jamm
"What, what, what?",Tom Haverford
There she is.,Tom Haverford

I don't even need an exact number.,Trevor Nelson
Just ballpark it.,Trevor Nelson
That's all I need to get started.,Trevor Nelson
"Or, I'm sure the state government would love to use your money to hire more bureaucrats, maybe build a library.",Ben Wyatt
"Fine, a ballpark figure.",Ron Swanson
Thank you.,Trevor Nelson
God.,Trevor Nelson
Holy [bleep].,Trevor Nelson
Is this a joke?,Trevor Nelson
"Another word for ""jokes"" is ""lies.""",Ron Swanson

You got me.,Jeremy Jamm
"I don't want fluoride in the water because I'm a dentist, and I like cavities.",Jeremy Jamm
"Yeah, that is not a valid reason.",Leslie Knope

It's a thrill to be here.,Leslie Knope

It's been a couple of months since Pawnee and Eagleton officially merged.,Leslie Knope
Things are going... okay.,Leslie Knope
There's still a little animosity between the two towns.,Leslie Knope
I haven't seen Pawneeans this mad since Frankie's discontinued their pizza stuffed crust pizza.,Leslie Knope

"Ms. Knope, I understand you're here today to try to convince us that this disastrous merger of our two towns was, in any way, a good idea.",August Clementine

And a rather large-scale brawl at the dump.,Leslie Knope
"But overall, the state of the merger is very strong.",Leslie Knope
Scoff.,August Clementine
"Did you just say the word ""scoff""?",Leslie Knope
"You must admit, Ms. Knope, that the merging of the towns has been fraught with antipathy.",Derry Murbles

"I asked for Larry's help because he has the most successful marriage of anyone I know, to a gorgeous woman.",Ben Wyatt
"Which, honestly, is still a mystery to me.",Ben Wyatt
"Like, was it a hypnosis accident or something, where they put Gayle under and made her fall in love with Larry and never said the magic word to snap her out of it?",Ben Wyatt
"Like, if I say ""nutmeg,"" will she wake up and start screaming?",Ben Wyatt
What kind of pet are you interested in adopting?,April Ludgate

"The Pawnee Eagleton merger has made for a rough year, both for me and for the town.",Leslie Knope
"But if I can pull off this unity concert and prove that this merger was a success, Pawnee might once again tolerate slash ignore me.",Leslie Knope
"I know that sounds bad, but for a politician it's pretty much the best-case scenario.",Leslie Knope
You guys might as well be a pile of leaves because you're about to get blown away.,Leslie Knope

Everything I try with this merger backfires.,Leslie Knope
I wonder what other excellent surprise lies in store for Leslie Knope.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, Grant Larson from the National Park Service is here for your meeting.",Jerry Gergich

Wonderful!,Leslie Knope

That's what makes businesses work-- passion!,Mitch Savner
"So Mr. Haverford, let's get to it.",Mitch Savner
What idea are you passionate about?,Mitch Savner
"I've got two words for you-- ""Tom's Bistro,"" an old-fashioned, old-world Italian restaurant.",Tom Haverford
"Classy, authentic ambience in a small-town setting.",Tom Haverford
"Why does that say ""dry cleaning chemical transactional holding company?""",Mitch Savner
Ben! You brought the wrong easel.,Tom Haverford
God! Can't take this guy anywhere.,Tom Haverford
Let me paint you a picture.,Tom Haverford
"Oh, Mr. Larson, I'm sorry.",Leslie Knope
I had to reschedule.,Leslie Knope
It's been kind of a hectic week.,Leslie Knope
What happened to your face?,Grant Larson
It doesn't matter.,Leslie Knope
I would like to apply to turn some of our new land into a national park.,Leslie Knope
"I read your request, Ms. Knope, and I'm sorry, but we can't make that happen.",Grant Larson
Great.,Leslie Knope
"Well, this week just keeps getting better and better.",Leslie Knope
Thank you for coming by and plunging a dagger into my already-bleeding corpse.,Leslie Knope
I came here because I wanted to meet you.,Grant Larson
I've actually wanted to meet you since before you called me.,Grant Larson
Really? You know who I am?,Leslie Knope
Yes.,Grant Larson
You're the person who wrote this.,Grant Larson
You read my proposal to clean up the Pawnee river? I wrote this two years ago.,Leslie Knope
Got shuffled around in interior for a year and half.,Grant Larson
"Liam Bonneville actually used it to humiliate staffers, but he's kind of a bad boy.",Grant Larson
Liam B-- You don't have to tell me!,Leslie Knope
This report is legendary.,Grant Larson
It's easily the most thoroughly research and passionate grant request I've ever seen.,Grant Larson
"Wow, you have no idea how meaningful it is to hear you say that.",Leslie Knope
But you're a little late.,Leslie Knope
The river cleanup's well underway.,Leslie Knope
This is bigger than the river cleanup.,Grant Larson
We're opening a new office in Chicago.,Grant Larson
I spent the last few weeks reading about you and your career and I think that you're the perfect person to run it.,Grant Larson
"Leslie, would you like to run a branch of the National Park Service?",Grant Larson
"Tom's Bistro will have all the classic elements, but with modern twists-- an oak bar, live music, and Sunday brunch with scrambled eggs so fluffy they'll be like little pillows for your bacon.",Tom Haverford
Bacon pillows.,Mitch Savner
I like the sound of that.,Mitch Savner
"But I have to say, restaurants are incredibly risky.",Mitch Savner
Most of them are dead on arrival.,Mitch Savner
"We're well-aware of that, but believe me, Tom has thought this out.",Ben Wyatt
"See, there's plenty of real estate available in the old Eagleton part of town.",Ben Wyatt
"And with the recent closures, there's massive demand for affordable dining that feels high-end.",Ben Wyatt
"Okay! As long as you're running, I'm in.",Mitch Savner
Amazing!,Tom Haverford
"Hey, kid your boss here sure knows his stuff.",Mitch Savner
Ron.,Leslie Knope
What are you doing here?,Leslie Knope
The most important government work I've ever done-- sanding rat urine stains out of this floor.,Ron Swanson
What are you doing here?,Ron Swanson
I come here to think sometimes.,Leslie Knope
By myself.,Leslie Knope
But now that you're hereâ¦,Leslie Knope
Damn it.,Ron Swanson
"I am going to speak to you very vaguely about a problem that I have, and you cannot ask me any questions or details about it.",Leslie Knope
"That is my ideal conversation, aside from no conversation.",Ron Swanson
But that feels unlikely.,Ron Swanson
"Look, you know how much I love Pawnee.",Leslie Knope
But the more I try to fix it the more people fight me.,Leslie Knope
"They call me names, they recall me, they try to kill the merger.",Leslie Knope
They literally punch me in the face.,Leslie Knope
"And yet every time I contemplate leaving, just walking away once and for all, I just can't do it.",Leslie Knope
What is wrong with me?,Leslie Knope
"Yesterday, I fixed that old steam radiator.",Ron Swanson
"Threaded a new valve into the side, removed the handle from the base, unscrewed the packing nut from the stem.",Ron Swanson
"This subpar toolbox only had one wrench, so I was lucky it was a three-quarters or I'd have been screwed.",Ron Swanson
"Yeah, man, you are lucky.",Leslie Knope
"Come on, Ron.",Leslie Knope
What the hell? I need your help.,Leslie Knope
"By the time I was done, this 100-year-old piece of American-made cast iron was singing like a bird.",Ron Swanson
"Now, to most people, this story would seem boring.",Ron Swanson
That's ridiculous.,Leslie Knope
It's a story about a radiator.,Leslie Knope
"But to me, it was immensely satisfying because I enjoy fixing radiators.",Ron Swanson
"You like fixing this town, Leslie, you always have.",Ron Swanson
"You know it's an uphill battle, but you love the struggle.",Ron Swanson
"I would also add that you've already done a hell of a lot to make this town better, and people like this young man here will benefit from your hard work.",Ron Swanson
He is a beautiful boy.,Leslie Knope
He's quite a looker.,Ron Swanson
"Thank you, Ron.",Leslie Knope
What's that?,Leslie Knope
Nothing.,Ron Swanson
Clearing my throat.,Ron Swanson
I've been thinking about your offer.,Leslie Knope
And I have to say I can't think of one single reason not to take it.,Leslie Knope
That's great! I'll start drawing up the paperwork.,Grant Larson
"I'm sorry, I meant because I can think of a lot of reasons not to take it.",Leslie Knope
"Okay, wow, that's very misleading phraseology.",Grant Larson
I'm sorry.,Leslie Knope
"It's an amazing offer and I'm very interested, but if I'm going to leave Pawnee I need to know it's gonna be okay without me.",Leslie Knope
And I won't know until I finish what I've started.,Leslie Knope
When do you need your answer?,Leslie Knope
"Well, the gears of federal government grind pretty slowly, so you have a little time.",Grant Larson
But we can't wait forever.,Grant Larson
I'll be in touch.,Grant Larson
Great.,Leslie Knope
Thank you.,Leslie Knope
That's not your hand.,Leslie Knope
Here it is.,Leslie Knope
"Sorry, my depth perception is totally screwed up.",Leslie Knope
"Really happy that worked out for you, Tom, but you kinda sold me out back there.",Ben Wyatt
"I know, and I'm sorry.",Tom Haverford
"But Mitch asked me what I was passionate about, and honestly I'm never gonna be passionate about dry cleaning chemicals.",Tom Haverford
"To each his own, I guess.",Ben Wyatt
"I know opening a restaurant is risky, but I can make this work.",Tom Haverford
I know I can!,Tom Haverford
Then count me in as the second investor in Tom's Bistro.,Ben Wyatt
"Thanks, man.",Tom Haverford
"I know this is a symbolic gesture, but my investor floor is $1,000.",Tom Haverford
"So as of now, you own zero shares.",Tom Haverford
Cool! Thanks for clearing that up.,Ben Wyatt
"Now go do work, or I will fire you.",Ben Wyatt
I'm not kidding.,Ben Wyatt
Yep!,Tom Haverford
"Oh, look, John.",Ron Swanson
It's red pine.,Ron Swanson
They were gonna put flecked linoleum over this beautifully preserved knotty red pine.,Ron Swanson
"Most people in this world, John, are ass[bleep].",Ron Swanson
"This is the best day I've ever spent in a government building, and luckily my son was here to share it with me.",Ron Swanson
He now has that satisfied look that only comes with the pride of labor.,Ron Swanson
Or he pooped.,Ron Swanson
"Either way, well done, John.",Ron Swanson
"Okay, I don't want to over-hype this, but presenting... Dun-da-da-dah!",Ben Wyatt

Cool.,Andy Dwyer
Anything else?,Andy Dwyer
I hear Cozy's Bar is pretty packed on Thursdays.,Craig Middlebrooks

This is like the parks equivalent of Bruce Springsteen pulling Courtney Cox onstage.,Leslie Knope
"I mean, one minute you're just a regular girl in the crowd, and the next minute you're dancing 10 feet away from freakin' Max Weinberg!",Leslie Knope
"Okay, my fortieth and eighteenth from last question is about the Heartland Exotic Plant Management Project.",Leslie Knope
"Now, were would I be actually doing the physical planting?",Leslie Knope
"Because it is always been a dream of mine to plant spotted jewelweed along the red river bank in Arkansas, but I'm sure you hear that a lot.",Leslie Knope
"Well, you wouldn't actually be planting things.",Grant Larson
"I mean, you're overseeing 200 people.",Grant Larson

"And then there is Glenwater, Florida, home of America's most violent Walmart parking lot.",Leslie Knope

"Yeah, see, that's the super cool thing about this website is it does all the work for us so we can just sit back and take it easy.",Ben Wyatt
No.,Leslie Knope
"No, we're not gonna do that.",Leslie Knope

"We should have a press junket, to publicize the poll.",Leslie Knope
"Okay, I hope you had lunch plans, 'cause now you get to cancel them.",Leslie Knope

"Quiet, cameraman, Perd's here.",Leslie Knope

And a slogan is a series of words that have a meaning.,Perd Hapley
"So true, Perd.",Leslie Knope
"All of the choices for the town slogan are wonderful, but if I had to choose my favorite it would probably be ""Storied past, bright future.""",Leslie Knope

"Joan, this poll is a chance to give our newly merged city a new identity to really rebrand this town.",Leslie Knope

What?,Leslie Knope
Crazy Ira and the Douche got their bonehead radio fans to flood the poll with write-in votes.,Ben Wyatt
Why did we include a write-in option?,Ben Wyatt
Because every election has a write-in option.,Leslie Knope
That's how democracy works.,Leslie Knope
I'm not a dictator.,Leslie Knope
"If I we're a dictator, I would throw the Douche in prison without a trial.",Leslie Knope

It will strengthen Gryzzl's bid.,Tom Haverford
Is a celebrity necessary?,Ron Swanson
I prefer quality over flash.,Ron Swanson

Yeah.,Leslie Knope
"See, Ben?",Leslie Knope
It all works out.,Leslie Knope

But he's our embarrassing footnote.,Leslie Knope
"I've recently self published a biography about Harrison entitled ""Barely a President. William Henry Harrison's Thirty Two Days in the White House.""",Bill Haggerty
I discovered that Harrison had a heretofore unknown hunting lodge on the very land you're trying to acquire.,Bill Haggerty

Can't we just say it was there?,Ben Wyatt
You're asking a notary to lie.,Jerry Gergich
"I signed an oath, Ben.",Jerry Gergich
And then a different notary notarized the oath I signed.,Jerry Gergich
William Henry Harrison is totally ridiculous.,April Ludgate
They can't even fill a small museum with real stuff about his life because he was so lame.,April Ludgate

People would come from miles just to see it.,Leslie Knope
Why?,Andy Dwyer
Was there something inside the stupid ball?,Andy Dwyer
Ooh!,Andy Dwyer
Like a giant hamster?,Andy Dwyer
"This is what we have to work with, okay?",Leslie Knope
"We are up against a very flashy Internet company, and we should be aiming for quantity over quality.",Leslie Knope
"So, we're going to throw a bunch of Harrison facts at them and a big pile of bricks and whatever else we can find.",Leslie Knope
"Quantity, people!",Leslie Knope
Quantity!,Leslie Knope

"Also, there's a flirty trend in beverages.",Annabel Porter
"So, you've had soy milk and almond milk.",Annabel Porter
"Now, try the hottest new craze, beef milk.",Annabel Porter
It's like almond milk that's been squeezed through tiny holes in living cows.,Annabel Porter
That's [bleep] milk.,Ron Swanson

And we need all of this stuff.,Leslie Knope

"Man, those two really hate each other.",Tom Haverford
"That feud is, like, Biggie Tupac level.",Tom Haverford
Maybe even Morgan Freeman Shailene Woodley level.,Tom Haverford
Naw.,Donna Meagle
"It's bad, but it's not that bad.",Donna Meagle
This is like when the triplets fight except I can't just give Leslie and Ron stuffed animals to make them calm down.,Ben Wyatt
"Actually, that might work.",Ben Wyatt
Have we tried that?,Ben Wyatt
"Well, they've always butted heads, but I really I don't think they hate each other.",Jerry Gergich
I just think they're very different people and they've just drifted apart once they stopped working in the same office.,Jerry Gergich
You okay?,Ben Wyatt
Yeah.,Leslie Knope
"Well, I ordered 60 veggie pizzas to Ron's office.",Leslie Knope
"So, that calmed me down a little.",Leslie Knope
I know you're furious at him.,Ben Wyatt
"But please, come to a neutral site and sit with Ron for 30 seconds so I can get this dumb document signed.",Ben Wyatt
Ugh.,Leslie Knope
"I'll let you rename the triplets Ruth, Bader, and Ginsburg.",Ben Wyatt
"Okay, fine.",Leslie Knope
But I get to sign first.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, my God.",Ben Wyatt
"All right, let's just get this over with.",Leslie Knope
Let me get that for you.,Ben Wyatt
Got them!,Ben Wyatt
What? What's going on? What's going on?,Leslie Knope
Let us out immediately.,Ron Swanson
No.,Ben Wyatt
You guys are being ridiculous.,Ben Wyatt
"This has gone too far, and you are not leaving this office until you've made peace.",Ben Wyatt
No!,Leslie Knope
No!,Ron Swanson
No.,Ron Swanson
No.,Ron Swanson
No.,Ron Swanson
"Sorry, Ron.",Ben Wyatt
Doors are locked.,Ben Wyatt
We've taken your keycards and your phones and the automatic timer won't go off until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.,Ben Wyatt
You're trapped in there.,Ben Wyatt
We told security not to disturb you under any circumstances.,Tom Haverford
And the phones and Internet?,Tom Haverford
"Oh, they've been disconnected.",Tom Haverford
And I left a rusty hacksaw on the table.,April Ludgate
"So, the first person who hacks their face off gets released.",April Ludgate
That's not-- What?,Andy Dwyer
Is that true?,Andy Dwyer
"Guys, this is insane, okay?",Leslie Knope
Let us out.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, my God, babe, Game of Thrones is on tonight!",Leslie Knope
It's the series finale.,Leslie Knope
Khaleesi is marrying Jack Sparrow.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, God, that show has really gone off the rails.",Leslie Knope
"Look, it makes sense if you've read the books.",Ben Wyatt
"Look, our baby monitor is on the table.",Ben Wyatt
"If you guys can talk this out and settle your differences like grownups, turn it on and I will come to get you from my office.",Ben Wyatt
"Otherwise, we will see you at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.",Ben Wyatt
I am going to break out of here.,Ron Swanson
"Then, I am going to snap you in half.",Ron Swanson
Hey!,Donna Meagle
"This is not his fault, Swanson.",Donna Meagle
Be a man and get your house in order.,Donna Meagle
"You, too, Knope.",Donna Meagle
"Good luck, you guys.",Jerry Gergich
I really hope you can work out your differences.,Jerry Gergich
Terry.,Ron Swanson
Look at me.,Ron Swanson
Is this what you want to do?,Ron Swanson
"Think very carefully, son.",Ron Swanson
There you go.,Leslie Knope
"That's right, buddy.",Leslie Knope
Come on.,Leslie Knope
"For once in your life, do something right.",Leslie Knope
"Stop it, Terry!",April Ludgate
Both of you.,April Ludgate
Come on.,April Ludgate
"Damn it, Terry!",Ron Swanson
"Damn it, Terry!",Leslie Knope
Okay.,Ron Swanson
Think.,Ron Swanson
There must be a way out of here.,Ron Swanson
I don't think there is.,Leslie Knope
They installed these magnetic locks two years ago.,Leslie Knope
There's no way around them.,Leslie Knope
"Yes, there is.",Ron Swanson
I'll simply punch my fist through a window.,Ron Swanson
"Ron, there's security wire in there.",Leslie Knope
You'll slice your arm open.,Leslie Knope
I would rather bleed out than sit here and talk about my feelings for 10 hours.,Ron Swanson
There is another way.,Leslie Knope
"We'll just wait a few minutes, turn on this monitor, and then we'll tell Ben that we talked it out and made up.",Leslie Knope
"I'll just tell them that I apologized for, whatever, heroically caring too much.",Leslie Knope
"And you admitted that you were a stubborn butthead, and everything's fine now.",Leslie Knope
Why do I have to be stubborn?,Ron Swanson
Why can't the problem have been that I was reasonable and you were at fault?,Ron Swanson
Because we want them to believe us and not laugh really hard at a ridiculous science fiction scenario.,Leslie Knope
We are not saying I was the problem.,Ron Swanson
"If we're going to lie to them, I will not let you lie to them.",Ron Swanson
"Fine, I'll tell them that, for the past three years, you've been a perfect gentleman and scholar, and I am an insane weirdo who, despite being the only reason we even had a friendship to begin with, decided to ruin it, out of the blue, for no good reason.",Leslie Knope
That sounds good.,Ron Swanson
Let's go with that.,Ron Swanson
Hut!,Leslie Knope
What are you doing?,Ron Swanson
I destroyed the monitor!,Leslie Knope
What if we have an emergency and have to get out of here?,Ron Swanson
I did not consider that possibility!,Leslie Knope
Everything's different.,Leslie Knope
"I mean, the furniture, the pictures Craig changed everything.",Leslie Knope
Did he?,Ron Swanson
I tried not to notice anything when I worked here.,Ron Swanson
"Or talk to anyone, or learn anyone's name.",Ron Swanson
"You of all people should know that, Lauren.",Ron Swanson
"Look, we are going to be here for 10 hours.",Leslie Knope
"We can either talk about our issues and work through our problems, or we can just sit here doing nothing.",Leslie Knope
"I choose ""sit here.""",Ron Swanson
"Come on, Ron, why don't we just--",Leslie Knope
Sit here.,Ron Swanson
Ron.,Leslie Knope
Sit here.,Ron Swanson
I bet I can make you talk.,Leslie Knope
"I'll take that bet at any odds, for any amount of money, over any length of time stretching from now into infinity.",Ron Swanson
Talk to me.,Leslie Knope
Talk to me.,Leslie Knope
Talk to me.,Leslie Knope
Talk to me.,Leslie Knope
Talk to me.,Leslie Knope
Talk to me.,Leslie Knope
Talk.,Leslie Knope
Talk.,Leslie Knope
Talk.,Leslie Knope
Talk to me!,Leslie Knope
Drip.,Leslie Knope
Drip.,Leslie Knope
"One word, and this is over.",Leslie Knope
"I think wood is stupid, and so does everybody else.",Leslie Knope
"You guys, Ron loves plastic.",Leslie Knope
"Last chance, Ron.",Leslie Knope
You want to talk?,Leslie Knope
Huh?,Leslie Knope
Ah-hah!,Leslie Knope
Jackpot.,Leslie Knope
"You know what this is, Ron?",Leslie Knope
"This is a mix I made for the summer Parks barbecue, 2007.",Leslie Knope
I asked everyone in the Parks Department to choose one song.,Leslie Knope
You chose Buddy by Willie Nelson.,Leslie Knope
A fact I remember because my mind is a steel trap of friendship nuggets.,Leslie Knope
But I am not going to play your choice.,Leslie Knope
I'm gonna play Jerry's choice.,Leslie Knope
Ooh!,Leslie Knope
That's right.,Leslie Knope
And I'm gonna sing along.,Leslie Knope
And I'm gonna maintain eye contact the whole time.,Leslie Knope
And guess what?,Leslie Knope
I don't know the words.,Leslie Knope
"Harry Truman was a guy America, Red China All the countries, other people Everyone is fun Joe Mantegna, lan McKellen I have to buy a new toaster This is awesome You're so stupid Jumping up and down Whoo!",Leslie Knope
I got it on repeat.,Leslie Knope
"Come on, Ron.",Leslie Knope
"Do you want to hear it again, or do you want to talk?",Leslie Knope
No?,Leslie Knope
"Okay, next verse.",Leslie Knope
Freddy Krueger bought some pants Oprah has a turtle farm Peter Piper peepee poopy Daddy ate a squirrel,Leslie Knope
Stop this!,Ron Swanson
I will speak with you for three minutes.,Ron Swanson
Great.,Leslie Knope
"So, what would you like to talk about?",Ron Swanson
"Oh, come on, Ron.",Leslie Knope
We were friends for 10 years.,Leslie Knope
We were work proximity associates.,Ron Swanson
We were friends.,Leslie Knope
And now we're not.,Leslie Knope
"And once again, it is up to me to save our friendship.",Leslie Knope
And I will do so using the most powerful tool known to man.,Leslie Knope
A well organized chart.,Leslie Knope
"Three years ago, I accept a job at National Parks.",Leslie Knope
"You and I see each other less, admittedly, due to my busy schedule and your utter lack of interest in maintaining adult friendships.",Leslie Knope
Work proximity associateships.,Ron Swanson
"Three months later, April comes to work for me.",Leslie Knope
We throw her a party.,Leslie Knope
"At her request, the party's theme is ""Zombie Teenage Biker Gang Pizza Jamboree.""",Leslie Knope
I remember.,Ron Swanson
You made me wear a leather jacket.,Ron Swanson
That is the last time you and I see each other for more than five minutes.,Leslie Knope
"Three months later, you come and visit me at my office on the third floor for the very first time.",Leslie Knope
"One week later, I return from a trip, and I find out you have quit the Parks Department and you have started your own building company without even bothering to tell me.",Leslie Knope
"""Oh, well,"" I think to myself, ""You know, it was only a matter of time.""",Leslie Knope
"And then, two months after that, Morningstar, the final twist of the knife.",Leslie Knope
"Oh, for God's sake.",Ron Swanson
"I hear about Morningstar, and I calmly saunter down to your office and attempt to have a rational discussion with you about it.",Leslie Knope
"What the hell, Ron?",Leslie Knope
You're building your stupid building on the block next to Pawnee Commons?,Leslie Knope
The park that I built from scratch out of a pit?,Leslie Knope
"This building is gonna ruin the views, you jerk.",Leslie Knope
And you're gonna tear all the houses down?,Leslie Knope
Yes.,Ron Swanson
"Ann lived there, Ron.",Leslie Knope
That's Ann's old house.,Leslie Knope
That's my best friend's old house.,Leslie Knope
That was the house where I put on my wedding dress the night I got married.,Leslie Knope
That is the house where April and Andy met for the first time.,Leslie Knope
That is the house where Ann gave me my first ever smoky eye look.,Leslie Knope
She hasn't lived there for five years.,Ron Swanson
That's not the point.,Leslie Knope
This building is a monstrosity.,Leslie Knope
And what's it called?,Leslie Knope
"""Morningstar?""",Leslie Knope
"""Oh, dear.""",Leslie Knope
"""We live at the Morningstar.""",Leslie Knope
"""That's so posh and hibbley fibbley gibbley.""",Leslie Knope
The world needs apartment buildings.,Ron Swanson
The park you built is nice and people want to live next to it.,Ron Swanson
That's not the point.,Leslie Knope
"You knew that I would be furious, and you didn't have the guts to tell me yourself.",Leslie Knope
"Enjoy your new job, Judas.",Leslie Knope
You tear down Ann's house.,Leslie Knope
"You spend the next two years cutting down trees and fighting zoning laws that I helped pass, basically spitting on everything we did together at Parks.",Leslie Knope
That's not the whole story.,Ron Swanson
What does that mean?,Leslie Knope
It means what it means.,Ron Swanson
That is not the whole story of why I left.,Ron Swanson
"Sorry, your time is up.",Ron Swanson
Wait.,Leslie Knope
Why then?,Leslie Knope
What was the reason?,Leslie Knope
"Ron, come on.",Leslie Knope
"Oh, my God, you made a key?",Leslie Knope
"Ron, please, don't--",Leslie Knope
"Come on, Ron.",Leslie Knope
"Ron, just talk to me.",Leslie Knope
"Ron, come on!",Leslie Knope
See you tomorrow morning.,Ron Swanson
Okay.,Leslie Knope
Progress.,Leslie Knope
Is it that I sent you a birthday card through the US mail so the post office knew your address?,Leslie Knope
No.,Ron Swanson
Go away.,Ron Swanson
"Oh, is it because I had Food and Stuff temporarily shut down due to a health code violation?",Leslie Knope
That was you?,Ron Swanson
They had fresh produce out right next to the roach spray.,Leslie Knope
The name of the store is Food and Stuff.,Ron Swanson
"They sell food, and they sell stuff.",Ron Swanson
"If you don't like it, go to that new place, Complete Food.",Ron Swanson
It's called Whole Foods.,Leslie Knope
And is that really the reason?,Leslie Knope
No.,Ron Swanson
How many more questions are you going to ask me?,Ron Swanson
As many as I need to to solve this mystery and get us engaged in a deep and stimulating conversation about our friendship.,Leslie Knope
"Ron, what are you doing?",Leslie Knope
I know I saw it.,Ron Swanson
Ah-hah!,Ron Swanson
Detonator.,Ron Swanson
The partially defused Claymore mine you gave me 10 years ago.,Ron Swanson
I'm gonna use it to blow a hole in this damn door so I can get out of here.,Ron Swanson
"Ron, just wait a second.",Leslie Knope
No.,Ron Swanson
"I'm being held as a prisoner against my will, and I have the right, as a citizen of the United States, to blow a hole in that [bleep] door and walk out as a free man.",Ron Swanson
It's in the Constitution.,Ron Swanson
There's no cursing in the Constitution.,Leslie Knope
"Look, before you do thatâ¦",Leslie Knope
Too late.,Ron Swanson
Here we go.,Ron Swanson
Fire in the hole!,Ron Swanson
Woohoo!,Leslie Knope
I gave you that as a gift on your fifth anniversary as Parks director.,Leslie Knope
You told me this was a genuine partially defused Claymore mine.,Ron Swanson
"Well, it was.",Leslie Knope
"I bought the empty shell off of eBay, and then I filled it with, you know, balloons and confetti and such.",Leslie Knope
You mean to tell me I have had a toy on my desk for 10 years?,Ron Swanson
You mean to tell me you've thought you had an actual land mine on your desk?,Leslie Knope
"Congratulations, Ron.",Leslie Knope
You've been doing an explosive job!,Leslie Knope
"Come on, Ron.",Leslie Knope
It's funny stuff.,Leslie Knope
Who gets angry at balloons?,Leslie Knope
Good talk.,Leslie Knope
What's all this?,Ron Swanson
"I'm just reading back through some of our old projects, trying to figure out what happened that made you quit.",Leslie Knope
"Good God, woman.",Ron Swanson
This is a code.,Leslie Knope
I am going to break it.,Leslie Knope
And this is my best shot.,Leslie Knope
Is that nuclear waste?,Ron Swanson
No.,Leslie Knope
This is my job application from when you hired me.,Leslie Knope
How did you get that?,Ron Swanson
Freedom of Information Act request.,Leslie Knope
But here's the thing.,Leslie Knope
I've never read it.,Leslie Knope
This application contains your very first impressions of me.,Leslie Knope
"It's the Rosetta Stone, Ron.",Leslie Knope
The beginning of the whole shebang.,Leslie Knope
This is all you wrote?,Leslie Knope
Three lousy lines?,Leslie Knope
Why would anyone need more than three lines?,Ron Swanson
"I'm describing a person, not something complicated like a wooden sailing ship or proper dovetail technique.",Ron Swanson
I forgot what I wrote.,Ron Swanson
Can I hear it?,Ron Swanson
Why don't you read it yourself?,Leslie Knope
"""Leslie Knope is an absurd idealist whose political leanings are slightly to the left of Leon Trotsky.""",Ron Swanson
"So far, so accurate.",Ron Swanson
"""If we were to work together, she would undoubtedly drive me insane, and it is possible that we would murder each other.""",Ron Swanson
You forgot the last sentence.,Leslie Knope
"No, I didn't.",Ron Swanson
I remember that part.,Ron Swanson
"It says, ""Hire her.""",Ron Swanson
Did you hear that?,Ron Swanson
It's a person.,Leslie Knope
It's another person!,Leslie Knope
Hello!,Ron Swanson
Hello!,Ron Swanson
Janitor!,Ron Swanson
Hey!,Leslie Knope
"Hey, we're trapped in here!",Leslie Knope
Hey!,Ron Swanson
"Please, Mr. Janitor.",Ron Swanson
"If you just look over here for two seconds, I'll do anything.",Ron Swanson
Hey!,Leslie Knope
I'll watch a foreign film.,Ron Swanson
I'll talk to a man with a ponytail.,Ron Swanson
Oh!,Leslie Knope
"He's gone, Ron.",Leslie Knope
He's gone.,Leslie Knope
Why did you give me the job?,Leslie Knope
And that's what I don't get.,Leslie Knope
We should've never worked together.,Leslie Knope
Why did you hire me?,Leslie Knope
Because of your interview.,Ron Swanson
"Okay, that doesn't make any sense.",Leslie Knope
"I mean, I remember that interview.",Leslie Knope
You were wearing that exact outfit.,Leslie Knope
"And you said to me, ""Ms. Knope, I have one question for you.""",Leslie Knope
"""What do you believe the role of government is in America?""",Leslie Knope
You blathered on for 10 minutes about social safety nets and honest governance and improving lives.,Ron Swanson
Basic nonsense.,Ron Swanson
"Then you said, ""Everything that just came out of your mouth is basic nonsense.""",Leslie Knope
"""Good day.""",Leslie Knope
And that was it.,Leslie Knope
"No, that was not it.",Ron Swanson
"After I said you were full of it, you got very angry and scrunched up your face and said, ""Excuse me, sir, but I disagree.""",Ron Swanson
Did you let me have it.,Ron Swanson
"That was one of your top 10 tirades, I'd say.",Ron Swanson
You were pounding your fist and shaking.,Ron Swanson
You called me a heartless thug.,Ron Swanson
I most certainly did not.,Leslie Knope
"You were tough and honest, and you stood up for what you believed in, even though it might've killed your chance to get the job.",Ron Swanson
I would rather work with a person like that than with a milquetoast yes-man.,Ron Swanson
Should be one more thing in that file.,Ron Swanson
"Oh, it's the thank you note I wrote to you after the interview.",Leslie Knope
You kept it.,Leslie Knope
"""Dear Mr. Swanson, I'm sorry for raising my voice in the interview, and I'm sorry I called you a heartless thug.""",Leslie Knope
"Oh, well, okay.",Leslie Knope
There you go.,Leslie Knope
"""If it matters, I promise I would never ""raise my voice at you if we worked together.""",Leslie Knope
Liar.,Ron Swanson
"Yeah, I was being really optimistic.",Leslie Knope
"""Please enjoy these homemade brownies as a gesture of goodwill.""",Leslie Knope
"""Leslie Knope.""",Leslie Knope
That was the real reason I hired you.,Ron Swanson
Those brownies were damn good.,Ron Swanson
"Ron, look how far we've come.",Leslie Knope
We're doing so great.,Leslie Knope
"Let's just bring it home, okay?",Leslie Knope
Let's just talk about our issues.,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, don't push it.",Ron Swanson
"Okay, fine.",Leslie Knope
"If I guess and guess right, you have to tell me.",Leslie Knope
Ready?,Leslie Knope
"Two years ago, you found out you were a quarter French and you had a nervous breakdown.",Leslie Knope
"Okay, playtime is over.",Ron Swanson
I'm getting out of here once and for all.,Ron Swanson
"No, Ron!",Leslie Knope
"God, no!",Leslie Knope
That alarm is just for sprinklers.,Leslie Knope
April kept pulling it.,Leslie Knope
So the fire department disconnected it.,Leslie Knope
I see.,Ron Swanson
Ron?,Leslie Knope
I found some towels.,Leslie Knope
You okay?,Leslie Knope
Wow.,Leslie Knope
"Apparently, Craig is studying yoga.",Ron Swanson
These are the only dry clothes I could find.,Ron Swanson
"Well, you look great.",Leslie Knope
I feel extremely angry.,Ron Swanson
"Oh, come on.",Leslie Knope
"Stop whining, you big baby.",Leslie Knope
I've seen you with your eyebrows blown off.,Leslie Knope
I've seen you without a mustache.,Leslie Knope
I've seen it all.,Leslie Knope
"There's nowhere to run, Ron.",Leslie Knope
You have tried every possible means of escape.,Leslie Knope
There's nothing to do but talk.,Leslie Knope
What happened to these workplace proximity associates?,Leslie Knope
Hmm?,Leslie Knope
Spill it.,Leslie Knope
You left.,Ron Swanson
"Then a month later, you took Terry with you.",Ron Swanson
"Yeah, well, we needed a mindless factotum, and he's the best there is.",Leslie Knope
Amen.,Ron Swanson
Then you took April.,Ron Swanson
"I didn't want her to go, as she had become one of my closest workplace acquaintances.",Ron Swanson
But your offer was too good to pass up.,Ron Swanson
So I didn't try to stop her.,Ron Swanson
Then Tom left to run his business.,Ron Swanson
Donna left to run hers.,Ron Swanson
"One day, I looked up.",Ron Swanson
Just didn't recognize anyone.,Ron Swanson
So I made a decision.,Ron Swanson
An unthinkable decision.,Ron Swanson
Hey.,Leslie Knope
"Well, my, my, my.",Leslie Knope
Do my eyes deceive me? Is that Ron Swanson?,Leslie Knope
"Hello, Leslie.",Ron Swanson
"Hello, April.",Ron Swanson
Larry.,Ron Swanson
"Uh, It's Terry now.",Jerry Gergich
Okay.,Ron Swanson
As luck would have it--,Ron Swanson
One second.,Leslie Knope
"Did you talk to Randy about the vote? Tell the Northeast that we need to put pressure on them, or else we're gonna be waiting forever, and I'm tired of waiting on them, okay? Okay.",Leslie Knope
"Sorry, this is a crazy day.",Leslie Knope
"So what's up with you, you big lug?",Leslie Knope
Nothing important.,Ron Swanson
Just thought you might want to have lunch.,Ron Swanson
Tomorrow?,Ron Swanson
I would love to.,Leslie Knope
It's been too long.,Leslie Knope
"JJ's Diner, 12:30?",Leslie Knope
Excellent.,Ron Swanson
See you then.,Ron Swanson
Okay.,April Ludgate
"So Randy says the House is voting tomorrow, and they need us in Washington to prep.",April Ludgate
"Oh, my God, really?",Leslie Knope
Yeah.,April Ludgate
"Okay, get us the first flight out of here and grab the Missouri files.",Leslie Knope
Meet me at my car.,Leslie Knope
"Hey, babe.",Leslie Knope
I got to go to Washington.,Leslie Knope
Can you pick up the kids?,Leslie Knope
"Oh... Oh, no.",Leslie Knope
"Ron, I stood you up for lunch.",Leslie Knope
"You did, yes.",Ron Swanson
"I waited for a while, but it was pretty easy to figure out what had happened.",Ron Swanson
Your life seemed pretty hectic.,Ron Swanson
Is that the rest of the story? That I stood you up?,Leslie Knope
You were going to ask me something.,Leslie Knope
That's why you wanted to have lunch.,Leslie Knope
"Ron, you were going--",Leslie Knope
I was gonna ask you for a job.,Ron Swanson
In the federal government.,Ron Swanson
Just saying it out loud feels dirty.,Ron Swanson
"You missed your friends, and you wanted to come up to the third floor and work with us again.",Leslie Knope
I can't even imagine how hard that must have been for you.,Leslie Knope
"God, why didn't I see that?",Leslie Knope
"Ron, I am so sorry.",Leslie Knope
I should've been a better friend to you.,Leslie Knope
"Honestly, Leslie, it's fine.",Ron Swanson
It was a punctuation mark on a sentence that had already been written.,Ron Swanson
My time in government work was over.,Ron Swanson
"Sure, I loved shutting things down and bleeding the rotting beast from the inside.",Ron Swanson
Your metaphors are so beautiful.,Leslie Knope
"But it was time for me to leave, and I didn't feel like explaining why to you or anyone.",Ron Swanson
"Everything that happened after, the fight we had, not giving you a heads-up when my company took on the Morningstar development and bulldozed the nurse's old house, I do regret that.",Ron Swanson
I had a good run here.,Ron Swanson
"But after you and Tom and Donna and April and Terry left, when I looked around this office, nothing was the same.",Ron Swanson
"Yeah, well, there's a way to fix that.",Leslie Knope
England's got a new queen Everybody's really mean We didn't start the fire It was always burning Since the world's been turning,Leslie Knope
"Well, this is different from what I expected to find.",Ben Wyatt
"Morning, guys.",Leslie Knope
"Good morning, Leslie.",Andy Dwyer
"What did you do to the office? Ron, you're wearing my yoga clothes.",Craig Middlebrooks
You're gonna stretch out the elastic.,Craig Middlebrooks
We're sorry.,Leslie Knope
Fire and money and people,Leslie Knope
Hey.,April Ludgate
I moved our meetings to tomorrow because you are drunk and hungover simultaneously at 2:00 in the afternoon.,April Ludgate
"Yeah, good call.",Leslie Knope
"Also, you have a visitor.",April Ludgate
"No, whoever it is, I have zero interest in--",Leslie Knope
Hello.,Ron Swanson
"Ron! Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron.",Leslie Knope
"We just spent 12 hours together, woman.",Ron Swanson
Don't care.,Leslie Knope
I have three years' worth of hugs to force upon you against your will.,Leslie Knope
I have a small object for you.,Ron Swanson
"Call it an official peace offering, I suppose.",Ron Swanson
"Wow, this is very sweet.",Leslie Knope
But you do realize I gave you this picture six hours ago.,Leslie Knope
The frame is the gift.,Ron Swanson
"When my company took on the Morningstar development, and I realized it meant bulldozing Ann's old house, I salvaged her front door.",Ron Swanson
Then I stripped off all the terrible paint and lacquer-- People really don't know how to finish wood properly.,Ron Swanson
And I made it into this frame for you in the event that you and I everâ¦,Ron Swanson
Ron.,Leslie Knope
"You big, fat, giant sap.",Leslie Knope
That seems unnecessary.,Ron Swanson
I love it.,Leslie Knope
But I feel bad.,Leslie Knope
I don't have anything for you.,Leslie Knope
"For the first time in my life, I am present-less.",Leslie Knope
How about you buy me a meal? You hungry?,Ron Swanson
I'm starving.,Leslie Knope
"April, Ron and I are going to JJ's to eat too much breakfast food.",Leslie Knope
Why does anybody in the world ever eat anything but breakfast food?,Ron Swanson
"People are idiots, Ron.",Leslie Knope
Forget it.,Leslie Knope
It's impossible.,Leslie Knope
It's not gonna work in a million years.,Leslie Knope
It's pointless.,Leslie Knope
I give up.,Leslie Knope
"Good attitude, honey.",Ben Wyatt
"Well, you know, what do you want from me?",Leslie Knope
I'm trying to get a group of people to give me their land rather than sell it to Gryzzl for 90 million dollars.,Leslie Knope
"Right now, my basic argument is, ""Please give us the land.""",Leslie Knope
"""It would be so nice.""",Leslie Knope
Gryzzl has billions of dollars.,Leslie Knope
There's no way I beat them.,Leslie Knope
Hey.,Ben Wyatt
I've seen you beat tougher odds than this.,Ben Wyatt
They're just a company.,Ben Wyatt
They're not that powerful.,Ben Wyatt
Whoa!,Leslie Knope
"""Open your door?""",Leslie Knope
Ah!,Leslie Knope
"Oh, my God!",Leslie Knope
"Ben, we're about to die!",Leslie Knope
Good lord.,Ben Wyatt
"Oh, my, The robots have come for us.",Leslie Knope
I made fun of you when you said it would happen but your novel has come true.,Leslie Knope
"Hey, Leslie Knope.",Mike Bean
"Please enjoy this free gift, courtesy of Gryzzl.",Mike Bean
"Okay, so, they also have a squadron of flying robots giving presents to everyone.",Ben Wyatt
Later!,Mike Bean

Gryzzl's currently trying to buy an enormous parcel of land to build a permanent headquarters in Pawnee.,Trodd

And there's too much kale now.,Leslie Knope
One place asked me if I wanted kale in my milkshake.,Leslie Knope
"My milkshake, you guys.",Leslie Knope
"Even though I'm a firm believer in the free market, and your failure as a businessman is ultimately to blame, it's still a travesty your diner is closing.",Ron Swanson

Being the wife of is a minefield.,Jennifer Barkley
"If you were just a dingdong, I would just slap a flag pin on you, and pour some Valium down your throat, and just shove you behind the podium way upstage.",Jennifer Barkley
It's the smarties that freak people out.,Jennifer Barkley
I think you're underestimating the voters.,Leslie Knope
I don't think that is possible.,Jennifer Barkley

"But you are out of local government, and that's a step in the right direction.",Ron Swanson

What if I register for the contest?,Ben Wyatt
I bake the pie.,Ben Wyatt
I act as my own wife.,Ben Wyatt

"We sidestep the controversy, we refocus the campaign onto the actual candidate.",Leslie Knope
And then we flip the antiquated tradition right on its head.,Leslie Knope
Exactly.,Ben Wyatt

"She said that Governor Colquitt might be stepping down, and the DNC thinks that I should run for governor.",Leslie Knope
"Oh, God.",Ben Wyatt
That kind of sucks.,Ben Wyatt
Really?,Leslie Knope
Why?,Leslie Knope
"No, I mean, that's amazing.",Ben Wyatt
"It's just, Jen Barkley kind of approached me about running.",Ben Wyatt

Okay.,Leslie Knope
Pros of you running for governor.,Leslie Knope
You would be a great governor.,Leslie Knope
We could make Pawnee our home base.,Leslie Knope
The kids could go to school in Pawnee.,Leslie Knope
And it would be a huge career move for you.,Leslie Knope
The pros of me running for governor are the same thing.,Leslie Knope
It's the same list.,Leslie Knope
Right.,Ben Wyatt
The only con of you running would be that I don't get to run.,Leslie Knope
And vice versa.,Leslie Knope
Good.,Ben Wyatt
"So, we've solved it.",Ben Wyatt
Look.,Leslie Knope
We're going back to Pawnee in a week.,Leslie Knope
Why don't we just talk about it after that?,Leslie Knope
Good idea.,Ben Wyatt
"Hey, maybe we can drop by the old stomping grounds.",Ben Wyatt
See how the Parks Department has changed.,Ben Wyatt
I love it.,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Leslie Knope
Are you ready?,Leslie Knope
"No, but we don't have a choice, do we?",Leslie Knope
Kids!,Leslie Knope

"Bye, Dad.",Kid
"Bye, Mom.",Kid

Don't forget your ice skates.,Leslie Knope
You have a lesson tomorrow.,Leslie Knope
"Bye, Mom.",Kid
"Bye, Dad.",Kid
Bye.,Ben Wyatt
Want some broccoli?,Ben Wyatt
Ugh!,Leslie Knope
No.,Leslie Knope
"You know, now that I'm here, it's giving me an idea about this governor thing.",Leslie Knope
Maybe we need fresh eyes.,Leslie Knope
"You know, other people to weigh in.",Leslie Knope
We should talk to Ron.,Leslie Knope
Or Tom.,Leslie Knope
Or April.,Leslie Knope
Or Donna.,Leslie Knope
"Or Andy, even.",Leslie Knope
"Sometimes, he can be wise.",Leslie Knope
"Yeah, good idea.",Ben Wyatt
Let's call them.,Ben Wyatt
Or you know what else we could do?,Ben Wyatt
Just talk to them in person.,Ben Wyatt
Surprise!,Andy Dwyer
"Oh, wow.",Leslie Knope
"It's what you wanted, right?",Ben Wyatt
"Everyone in the same room, at the same time.",Ben Wyatt
I can't believe you.,Leslie Knope
We're all here together in the same room.,Leslie Knope
In this room.,Leslie Knope
I don't think I could be happier right now.,Leslie Knope
Want to bet?,Ben Wyatt
Hi.,Ann Perkins
"Oh, Ann's here.",Leslie Knope

"You guys, Ann's here.",Leslie Knope
Should we move away from here?,Ben Wyatt
Yeah.,Chris Traeger
"Yeah, this could go on for some time.",Chris Traeger
Aw.,Leslie Knope
"Your hair looks amazing, by the way.",Leslie Knope
You look like a cartoon princess.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, thank you.",Ann Perkins
It's from the pills I was telling you about.,Ann Perkins
"I took some of those, but I don't know, they didn't do anything and they kind of upset my stomach.",Leslie Knope
"No, you're supposed to crack them and leave them on your hair overnight.",Ann Perkins
Not eat them.,Ann Perkins
"Oh, no.",Leslie Knope
"Well, it's confusing, because they're delicious.",Leslie Knope
"Because my first book was such a smash, I had to come up with a new angle for the follow-up.",Tom Haverford
"Then, it hit me, Failure 2.0: Failing to Fail.",Tom Haverford
Love it.,Donna Meagle
How's everything? You properly treating yo' self out there in Seattle?,Tom Haverford
In a manner of speaking.,Donna Meagle
Joe and I spend most of our time on the foundation.,Donna Meagle
I can't believe you went non-profit.,Tom Haverford
"I mean, I love you, you're one of my best friends, but you have betrayed me and everything we stand for.",Tom Haverford
You've changed.,Tom Haverford
Maybe you're right.,Donna Meagle
"By the way, what time is it? Oh, it looks like it's half past spla-dow!",Donna Meagle
What? I take it all back.,Tom Haverford
That's a lot of diamonds.,Tom Haverford
"Gimme, gimme, gimme.",Tom Haverford
"Hey, Oliver.",April Ludgate
"Hey, Leslie.",April Ludgate
"Hello, Ann.",April Ludgate
"Hi, April.",Ann Perkins
"Your kids are, like, surprisingly awesome.",April Ludgate
Thank you.,Ann Perkins
"Did you use an egg donor, or give Chris a hall pass for a night?",April Ludgate
"Once again, they are my biological children.",Ann Perkins
"Once again, I don't believe you.",April Ludgate
"Ann, you rainbow-infused space unicorn.",Leslie Knope
"Ann, you beautiful, sassy mannequin come to life.",Leslie Knope
"Ann, you opalescent tree shark.",Leslie Knope
"Leslie, you are the master of the metaphor.",Chris Traeger
Oh.,Leslie Knope
I recently compared her to a nutrient-rich chia seed.,Chris Traeger
What's that thing on your wrist?,Leslie Knope
Oh!,Chris Traeger
You are extremely healthy.,Extra
I do that literally 50 times a day.,Chris Traeger
Aren't you afraid that thing might give you cancer?,Leslie Knope
"Well, I am now.",Chris Traeger
"Well, there he is.",Andy Dwyer
Chip Traeger.,Andy Dwyer
You old son of a gun.,Andy Dwyer
"Andy, it's Chris.",Chris Traeger
Is it? Huh.,Andy Dwyer
"Hello, Jack.",Ron Swanson
Ron Swanson.,Ron Swanson
Strong handshake.,Ron Swanson
"Well done, you two.",Ron Swanson
Thank you.,Andy Dwyer
"So, are you going to have another one?",Donna Meagle
Um Shh.,April Ludgate
Shh.,Andy Dwyer
'Cause 'Cause he's sleeping? How can you tell?,Andy Dwyer
"Oh, it's a common misconception that the Oculus holds all of the power.",Ben Wyatt
It's actually the Lamplighter.,Ben Wyatt
Ann.,Leslie Knope
"Oh, my God.",Leslie Knope
It's happening! It's totally happening.,Leslie Knope
Our kids are falling in love.,Leslie Knope
This is good.,Ann Perkins
"Okay, remember.",Ann Perkins
"If this is ever going to work, we have to pretend to disapprove.",Ann Perkins
Yeah.,Leslie Knope
Right.,Leslie Knope
Good call.,Leslie Knope
Hey!,Leslie Knope
"Leslie, no.",Ann Perkins
Oh.,Leslie Knope
Who cares?,Leslie Knope
"Ann Arbor, Michigan, is literally the greatest city that I have ever lived in.",Chris Traeger
But Pawnee is better.,Chris Traeger
"So, we're moving back.",Chris Traeger
That's great.,Ben Wyatt
Yeah.,Chris Traeger
I'm going to run admissions at Indiana.,Chris Traeger
I'm trading Wolverines for Hoosiers.,Chris Traeger
"Well, you're getting the better end of that deal.",Ron Swanson
Tom.,Ron Swanson
I took the quiz in your book about what kind of person I am.,Ron Swanson
I'm a Ron.,Ron Swanson
"Ha! I'm usually a Tom, but sometimes, I'm a Donna.",Tom Haverford
"Last time I took it, I was a Tom.",Ben Wyatt
What? No.,Tom Haverford
"No, no, no! Take it again.",Tom Haverford
I've got to go recalibrate the quiz.,Tom Haverford
"So, did anyone have any insights on our ""running for governor"" situation?",Ben Wyatt
"I've been so busy catching up with everyone, I haven't had a chance to ask them.",Leslie Knope
"Yeah, me neither.",Ben Wyatt
"Okay, here's what I think.",Leslie Knope
I hate when we're on opposite sides.,Leslie Knope
It stinks.,Leslie Knope
"Plus, if one of us runs, it doesn't mean we're going to win.",Leslie Knope
Right.,Ben Wyatt
And it's not like this is the only career option for either of us.,Ben Wyatt
"So, all that matters is that we are good.",Ben Wyatt
Right.,Leslie Knope
Which is why I have an idea.,Leslie Knope
I think we should flip a coin.,Leslie Knope
I mean it.,Leslie Knope
Let's literally flip a coin.,Leslie Knope
Because whoever runs is going to do a great job.,Leslie Knope
"And whoever doesn't run is going to be right alongside the other one, offering advice and support and whatever they need.",Leslie Knope
"So, it doesn't matter.",Leslie Knope
So let's flip a coin.,Leslie Knope
Okay.,Ben Wyatt
"You, Leslie Knope, the queen of planning and binders and pro and con lists.",Ben Wyatt
You want to leave this to chance?,Ben Wyatt
Yes.,Leslie Knope
"Because whatever's next, you and I are in it together.",Leslie Knope
"So, let's go tell everybody.",Leslie Knope
"And they can participate and they can sign the coin and then, you know, the coin will eventually make its way into the Smithsonian.",Leslie Knope
"Okay, everybody, gather around! First of all, I just have to say that all of you in the same room at the same time with your children here, it's like It's the greatest thing that's ever happened in the history of America.",Leslie Knope
"And secondly, Ben and I have an announcement.",Leslie Knope
Leslie is running for governor of Indiana.,Ben Wyatt
What?,All
"Bully for you, Knope.",Ron Swanson
That's amazing.,April Ludgate
"Yeah, she got approached by the DNC and they think she has a great shot to win.",Ben Wyatt
"Indiana native, supremely qualified, and she wrote that she wanted to be governor in her kindergarten dream journal.",Ben Wyatt
Just makes sense.,Ben Wyatt
"So, I'm running for governor.",Leslie Knope
"Ben is going to be running my campaign, because he's a super genius and he's got a tight, compact little body like an Italian sports car.",Leslie Knope
"But right now, I'd like to make a toast.",Leslie Knope
"When we worked here, together, we fought, scratched, and clawed to make people's lives a tiny bit better.",Leslie Knope
That's what public service is all about.,Leslie Knope
"Small, incremental change, every day.",Leslie Knope
"Teddy Roosevelt once said, ""Far and away, the best prize that life has to offer is a chance to work hard at work worth doing.""",Leslie Knope
And I would add that what makes work worth doing is getting to do it with people that you love.,Leslie Knope
"I started my career more than 30 years ago, in the Parks and Recreation Department right here in Pawnee, Indiana.",Leslie Knope
"I've had a lot of different jobs, including two terms as your governor.",Leslie Knope
"And soon, a new, unknown challenge awaits me.",Leslie Knope
"Which, to me, even now, is thrilling, because I love the work.",Leslie Knope
Not to say that public service isn't sexy.,Leslie Knope
Because it definitely is.,Leslie Knope
But that's not why we do it.,Leslie Knope
"We do it because we get the chance to work hard at work worth doing, alongside a team of people who we love.",Leslie Knope
"So, I thank those people who have walked with me, and I thank you for this honor.",Leslie Knope
"Now, go find your team, and get to work.",Leslie Knope
"In addition to Governor Knope's honorary doctorate from the School of Public Policy, in recognition of all she has done for the people of Indiana, the campus library will henceforth bear her name.",Extra
A [bleep] library?,Leslie Knope
"Yeah, that should do it.",Ron Swanson
The swing is fixed!,Ron Swanson
"Well, there you have it, sir.",Leslie Knope
Another problem solved by the hard work of dedicated public servants.,Leslie Knope
"Okay, great.",Extra
Bye.,Extra
"Yeah, that's about right.",Leslie Knope
Okay.,Leslie Knope
Well.,Leslie Knope
Hang on.,Jerry Gergich
"Gayle made me promise to get a quick picture, just for old times' sake.",Jerry Gergich
Good idea! Garry had a good idea.,Leslie Knope
Ugh.,Tom Haverford
The lighting is all wrong.,Tom Haverford
I'm going to send you a glamor shot.,Tom Haverford
Just photoshop me in later.,Tom Haverford
"I'm not going to show up in that picture anyway, because I'm a vampire.",April Ludgate
"Hey, babe, for this picture, should I be Burt Macklin, Johnny Karate, or my new character, Sergeant Thunderfist, M.D.?",Andy Dwyer
Where did you get that?,April Ludgate
Found it in the sandbox.,Andy Dwyer
Ew.,April Ludgate
Go Macklin.,Donna Meagle
Macklin's the hottest.,Donna Meagle
Get on with it.,Ron Swanson
I can't hold this smile forever.,Ron Swanson
I look ridiculous.,Ron Swanson
"Okay, hang on.",Jerry Gergich
Okay.,Jerry Gergich
"You ready, babe?",Ben Wyatt
Yes.,Leslie Knope
I'm ready.,Leslie Knope
That is a series wrap on Parks and Recreation.,Extra
